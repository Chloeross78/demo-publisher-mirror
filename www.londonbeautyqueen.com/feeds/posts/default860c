src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003EWhile I'm happy to skip the primer, eyeliner or blush on a daily basis, the one area of my regime I never gloss over is skin care. You can apply all the makeup (and use all the photoshop) in the world, but if the canvas beneath isn't luminous and hydrated the tell tale signs will still be there and shine through. This isn't about 'turning back the clock' or seeking out the skin you had as a teenager, but helping us to all look and feel our best while ageing gracefully. With the advances in science enabling us to treat our skin effectively and ensure it has all the ingredients it needs to work efficiently, there's no excuse for anyone to look exhausted - or to sit back and let nature take its course. I'm a firm believer in a comprehensive skincare regime and the benefits that using an eye cream, serum, day and night treatment can bring to the complexion, and a number of weeks ago No7 challenged ten bloggers to put it to the test and see what difference it could make to them.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-qSJ9ZNnlFoQ\/WLabW8xRNhI\/AAAAAAAAi0w\/Lv_Ctgd-zOA3FIwG4_1Nk_qQD9RBqIXNgCEw\/s1600\/Skincare%2BIs%2B%2523BetterTogether%2BWhy%2BYou%2BNeed%2BA%2BComplete%2BRegime%2BFor%2BLuminous%2B%2526%2BYouthful%2BLooking%2BSkin%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EOne of the big things I've learned over the years is that skincare  products really are #BetterTogether; that is, using a serum alongside an  eye cream, moisturiser and overnight treatment will provide far better  results than relying on a standalone product. At the start of the year No7 revolutionised its entire \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/No-7\/Skincare\/Age-range-45-60\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELift \u0026amp; Luminate\u003C\/a\u003E range (targeted at 40+ skin and including Day, Night and Eye Cream) to  help women’s skin look at its absolute best. (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2017\/01\/skincare-is-bettertogether-why-you-need.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERead my original feature here.\u003C\/a\u003E) This new and improved blend of ingredients  helps women achieve even better anti-ageing results that really deliver,  especially when using all four of the products together; the range has been proven to help tackle  the most common signs of ageing to deliver maximum results - wrinkles  are visibly reduced, skin appears lifted and is noticeably firmer, while  skin tone is more even. When clinically tested 88% of women saw even better results when they used the new day cream with the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/No-7\/Skincare\/Age-range-45-60\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELift \u0026amp; Luminate\u003C\/a\u003E serum - proving without a doubt that doubling up will give you even  better results in as little as two weeks.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI'm not quite old enough to put this to the test myself, so my mum kindly stepped in to try it for me over a number of weeks and has been pleasantly surprised by the results. Of her overall impressions, she said:\u003Ci\u003E \"The eye cream is quite thick and creamy, but sinks in well and definitely helps to reduce my morning puffiness a little. I love the serum; it makes skin feel really smooth and applies beautifully, so much so I could use it alone without makeup as it provides a really nice base. The day cream is really creamy, but it's not heavy so absorbs quickly to leave my skin feeling moisturised, while the really rich night cream is beautiful to apply before bed.\"\u003C\/i\u003E My mum isn't great at sticking to a regime and using multiple products in a day, so the No7 Lift \u0026amp; Luminate range has definitely helped her to get into a regime and understand the benefit using more than a little moisturiser can bring. She's thoroughly enjoyed testing all four products (and I know she'll come back asking for more when she's done!) \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhat's interesting is the results she's seen to her overall complexion, rather than focusing on individual fine lines and wrinkles. She said: \u003Ci\u003E\"I've actually been told I don't look as tired, so I presume the illuminating qualities are showing through! I've yet to notice any 'lifting' qualities yet, but maybe when I've used it a bit longer I'll start to notice a difference. Overall though my foundation applies better and the end result is much smoother, while my face still feels soft and moisturised at the end of the day. (A big difference for me.)\" \u003C\/i\u003EFor me the key difference in her skin is the overall appearance - rather than looking a little tired, she looks refreshed and subtly glowing (as well as younger than her 57 years.) And of the packaging? \u003Ci\u003E\"I really like the pots, which makes the range seem higher end - and something I'm proud to have on my dressing table.\"\u003C\/i\u003E So my mum is a big fan of the Lift \u0026amp; Luminate range, but what about the other bloggers that have been putting it to the test?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlex, I Heart Beauty: \u003Ci\u003E“I mainly look for products that will look after my skin over the long term and slow down the rate that it ages. I genuinely belief that the Lift \u0026amp; Luminate range will do that and can recommend it without hesitation.” \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETracey, Fighting Fifty: \u003Ci\u003E“If you are aged 40+ and are looking for products to actively work on fine lines, pigmentation and skin texture, while hydrating and protecting the skin, then the No7 Lift \u0026amp; Luminate range is definitely worth trying.” \u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EKate, Kate Louise Blogs: \u003Ci\u003E“My verdict? Well, if you wanted to try just one product, I'd say go for the eye cream, but the results I've had overall have come from using the range as a whole. So I guess that means I'm firmly in agreement with No7 - skincare really is #BetterTogether!”\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESareta, Kikki Blah Blah: \u003Ci\u003E“The No7 range all worked fabulously together to achieve the results that they said they would and what I hoped that they would do…bonus!

When I first started it was an odd sensation, standing in the middle of the street letting someone snap your photo and not really knowing where to look, but over the last few weeks I've definitely gotten into my stride - and developed my standard poses! It helps when you think that you're never going to see any of those curious faces again, that the streets of London are often so full of obscure goings on that a generic looking woman having her picture taken is really not going to stand out as the most memorable thing of the day. My outfits have been received so well, and you guys have been so positive, that it's definitely worth that slightly awkward hour in the street.

It's such a good way to keep your mojo strong and to connect with like-minded people (often bloggers are operating so solo that you can easily end up isolated, frustrated or lacking motivation\u003Cb\u003E,\u003C\/b\u003E) which we tie in with a tasty brunch and even a couple of meetings. Right now the second floor cafe in Fenwicks is our fave hangout, not only because of the tasty food and super accommodating staff who let us take over a booth for a day, but because you can always celeb spot: last time we had lunch across the way from Joan Collins! These shots were taken a stone's throw away from New Bond Street, where there are so many beautiful old fashioned buildings and flowers blooming as we step into spring. A few doors down is the iconic Claridges, so I was in pretty good company for the afternoon - and the decor even matched my outfit! \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-5Qm-CPWnLy8\/WLRlG4P69qI\/AAAAAAAAizo\/QQLSddD2aIcpD8dg45XBlcjb3IXx7toVQCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B4.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-cOI0FvhOT0A\/WLRk-3YWswI\/AAAAAAAAizk\/GCNEfF30ZtE_54QjkAQzJmNAxbUZGCULgCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B3.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-VRB_iXm8C7U\/WLRiqsPqOSI\/AAAAAAAAiyw\/UOvS9hY7T-Q0zB7YwLqkzOyNuWfuRF3dQCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-2EN2QaMnBMA\/WLRjvq5H_KI\/AAAAAAAAizI\/Xfe_hr3KcCYzHiQcF5bFLbhPD3aR9NPIACLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B6.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETHE OUTFIT\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EI have to admit this entire look has been re-hashed from things I've had in my wardrobe for an age and completely forgotten about; isn't that the best feeling, when you rediscover something and repurpose it into a brand new look?\u0026nbsp; The skirt is Topshop, bought a couple of years ago, and is equally great with a t-shirt in the summer as with tights and a jumper in the winter; because it's very volumous and made of a thick sweater-like material, it keeps you warm but also keeps you cool too. The jumper is a cheapo number from Primark, but the crop styles work so well with skirts (I hate having to tuck things in) that it's worth trawling through their displays to find a gem, while the shoes are last year's ASOS.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI bought these sparkly loafers after falling in love with them online, but when I first started to wear them they ripped my feet to shreds: I'd have to strategically plan where I was going and how much I was working if I wanted to wear them, as they were so blooming uncomfortable. However, when I rediscovered them at the bottom of my shoe basket this year they'd mysteriously become super comfy; I'll never understand the magic that means uncomfortable shoes miraculously become worn in without you even realising.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMy fave addition to any outfit though is my trusty Oasis leather jacket, which goes with absolutely everything. I adore the material, it's oh so comfy, plus it only gets better with age; it softens a super structured outfit, funks up a girlie look or makes your jeans-and-tee combo always seem more interesting. Personally I love putting it with a slightly more 'office appropriate' combo to relax the overall effect, while keeping me warm and covered up. You just can't go wrong with a leather jacket can you? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-IA22zkoYcX0\/WLRiji8S7-I\/AAAAAAAAiys\/hsC4-U04sNgSY5d932eyQ2AMWs4pzUUggCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B11.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/---PIIfXrVDM\/WLRjWW5D1bI\/AAAAAAAAiy0\/LAqN38VhCSY_OO9CFkp_BDnzIH2g1GfQwCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B12.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-7PK5kL4MydQ\/WLRjzTL5CKI\/AAAAAAAAizM\/OEeq3s1lDt48eTXWU7ja3pz4bqAltrR-QCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B8.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-8UQR6v4Rs0E\/WLRjoKMamSI\/AAAAAAAAizA\/bIk7xlHM9Woa8NkvC3ckQjEBRp9WdJBCgCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B16.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-Palt4HrCj3I\/WLRjh4lgTQI\/AAAAAAAAiy8\/kgO3HIXXx9srjktDC4vtqQyOkEpCncFxwCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B15.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-6uiSXhkZFfw\/WLRj6Zi4UFI\/AAAAAAAAizU\/YDG3teUBQ7YdeR31KBRizIgCKWb3L5QVwCLcB\/s1600\/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B17.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETHE ACCESSORIES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EMy current fave bag, the Givenchy Antigona, has been making numerous appearances since I picked it up in Bicester Village for a third off.\u0026nbsp; It's such a great size (it fits in all my stuff - including a camera, my book and a makeup bag) without feeling like I'm carrying around a suitcase; I've only had it a month or so but it's the best investment I've made in a long time. Even better is that it matches my leather jacket perfectly! In addition to the bag, a great pair of sunnies helps to keep a look casual whilst phasing you into the new season; right now there's a lot of sun even when it's still chilly, so a simple pair of \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2mGkhuo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eblack sunglasses\u003C\/a\u003E is an essential in my Givenchy.

I didn't know that Beaverbrooks engraved, but they have a whole range of jewellery that can be personalised for free - so if you fancy it it's well worth a look.

There's something nostalgic and incredibly comforting about the scent of our favourite childhood confectionery, especially as our sense of smell has been proven to be a powerful force in the formation of memory and emotion. For me there's nothing more comforting than the subtle scent of Palma Violets or breathing in the aroma of a Lemon Bon Bon, which is why I'm a little obsessed with Patisserie De Bain and all the sweet body treats they have on offer.

The scent of the classic little boiled sweets has been bottled and magically injected into a nourishing hand cream, so you can treat your hands to a pampering while simultaneously invigorating your senses. You can't apply this without a smile creeping across your face - especially as the magicians at Patisserie De Bain have managed to get the fragrance absolutely spot on. This could have ended up sugary sweet and a little overpowering, but in fact it has a scent that's practically indistinguishable from the real thing! The cream itself is really nourishing and creamy while still absorbing really fast to leave a silky soft finish; I love the fact I can use it while working and not have creamy fingerprints all over my laptop, or pop it on mid conversation and not have to massage my hands for ten minutes to get it all to sink in.

As strange as that sounds, I'm incredibly excited for Josh and I to enter this next chapter of our lives together and to see what the next few decades have in store. To all of you that have expressed your congratulations and left kind comments, thank you; it means a great deal and has made this period even more special for us. As a moment in time many of us look to as a memory to be cherished forever, an engagement in reality is quite strange and surreal: here I am with a ring on my finger, a pile of brochures and an email addressed to a registrar, but it doesn't quite seem like I'm looking towards one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. Right now it feels like I've simply got a big old sparkler on my hand and I'm having fun organising an almighty party for our loved ones. We've cracked open the champagne and told the tale oodles of times, I've shared snaps on my Instagram account and we've received so many lovely cards and gifts, so I thought it was about time I shared my story here - both as a way to remember it for years to come and to let you into an area of my life that's set to become all consuming in the following months. So here it is... \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-RsF8pso8DoY\/WLBQj13_HjI\/AAAAAAAAiww\/v2ULaKwXg-cKVsPulsMXyMozKMEToaOYgCLcB\/s1600\/My%2Bengagement%2Bstory%2Bring%2Bwedding%2Bplanning%2B1%2B.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPICKING THE RING\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EChoosing a ring that will adorn your hand for the rest of your days is a daunting task for anybody, especially for a guy who doesn't understand the first thing about jewellery. Although many women dream about their perfect dress or the ultimate cake, for me it's always been about the ring; for a long time (before I even met Josh) I've known exactly the kind of thing I wanted, which was cemented a few years ago when I took a trip to Amsterdam's Diamond Museum with a girlfriend. As we were the only two in the store the shop assistant insisted that we both try on everything in sight; my preference has always been a princess cut halo diamond, and that was undoubtedly the style that seemed to suit my hand best. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhen it came to choosing a ring, we'd spoken about getting married so many times before (and googled endless pictures for reference) that Josh knew the kind of direction to go in. However, with thousands of options to choose from it's no surprise that he got in a bit of a muddle and asked for help. My personal belief has always been that I'd prefer to be involved in the decision making process to ensure I had something I utterly adored, rather than chance him coming under a huge amount of pressure and picking something less than perfect. So we went shopping...\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIt was never our intention to go out for a first look and come back with a chosen (albeit yet to be purchased) ring, but that's what happened. Originally I wanted a bespoke ring made for me to my exact requirements, but the timescale and faff involved started to put me off. Having tried every single ring in one particular retailer, I knew what what suited my hand and what was utterly out of the question. What's interesting and important to know is that some rings just don't look right on your hand, whether they're too big\/too flat\/too dull, so you have to try them all to get a clearer understanding of what works. (I thought I wanted a piece of mega bling, but when I put on a certain ring Josh's exact words were \"it looks like it came out of a Christmas cracker.\" It was so big and so sparkly that it ended up looking like a piece of cosmetic jewellery; not ideal.)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI'm a firm believer in fate (cemented by the way we met, which you can read about if you're interested \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2016\/06\/our-love-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehere\u003C\/a\u003E,) and my ring and I were meant to be. It was the last ring I tried on in the last shop - and I wasn't even intending to go in, but thought I'd tick it off just to make sure I'd covered all bases. It wasn't even one I'd chosen myself, but it recommended by the sales assistant who popped it on my finger to try; it was the perfect style, the perfect fit, the perfect size, the perfect sparkle and even had 20% off as a special promotion. Instantly I got goosepimples and knew it was the one (and Josh was just pretty happy he'd be saving 20%.) That was it!\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETHE PROPOSAL\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EA few months after we chose the ring (and Josh secretly bought it) came the exciting part... Our first 'proper' date was on the London Eye, where we watched the sun set over the landscape and took in the incredible views. On the evening we got engaged, Josh had booked a restaurant that overlooked the Thames and the Eye (a special significance that I didn't realise until later.) There's no major story here and I don't want to go into the super personal details, but suffice to say we had a lovely evening - but the ring was yet to make an appearance. It wasn't until we got home that I knew something was up when Josh started to be soppier and more reflective than usual, eventually blindfolding me so he could get the gigantic ring box from out of his hiding place.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn reference to our favourite film, 'Back To The Future' Josh nervously asked me if I'd be his 'partner in time' while I (think) I grinned from ear to ear. After he finally got down on his knees to ask the question properly, I realised the size of the box was so gigantic that there was no way he could've hidden that in his jeans or coat pocket (a major flaw Mr Jeweller!) I'd always had the perception that rings come in little tiny boxes that can easily be concealed, but this one was so big it was about as subtle as a box of cereal. Hearing the words 'will you marry me' is such an odd and emotional experience and I reacted by bursting into tears and flinging my arms around Josh; he reacted by not even knowing which finger he should be putting it on! Men. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWEDDING PLANNING\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003ESo here we are. We're looking forward to the next few months as we plan our Big Day and enjoy all the trappings that come with it. We've got a date, a venue and a plan of action (as well as a tonne of Pinterest boards) so I'm going to thoroughly immerse myself in the process and enjoy every moment. The last couple of weeks have been spent googling, pinning and mentally scrapbooking and I think we both now know exactly what we want; being on the same page and having the same expectations certainly makes things easier, as there are no big decisions to make. Over the next six months or so I'll undoubtedly be sharing snippets and advice I learn, as well as bits and bobs after the big event; I want to be able to document the whole experience for not only ourselves, but for our future generations too.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHaving been looking all over the internet for advice and words of wisdom (of which too much is fluff and not enough practical suggestion,) I also want to be able to hopefully help any future brides reading this and reassure you that there's no need to stress or worry.

It's become a destination in its own right because of the purity of the colour scheme and the quality of the items within, but until now they've kept their focus very much to homewares. I was surprised to find out that the founder of The White Company was originally a beauty journalist and therefore incredibly passionate about skincare, so it makes complete sense that this year the brand are trying their hand at launching a capsule range of beauty products that very much fit within their ethos of minimalistic and aspirational shopping. Rather interestingly they've partnered with Deciem (who really know their stuff - they're the people behind The Ordinary, Niod, Hylamide, Fountain and Hand Chemistry) to bring this collection to life; if  you want the industry to stand up and take notice, then these are  undoubtedly the guys you'd turn to for help. Using their expertise to develop a collection that consists of a cleansing balm, night oil, moisturiser, concentrated serum and eye treatment, the result is a five piece line-up that provides a great basis for any skincare regime. But is it worth the hype, and more importantly the price? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-uTMnvjdXVHM\/WK8b9N9g_8I\/AAAAAAAAiv0\/Nr0E2R0FXPsXuoYTpp_3EqrBXhoyVz67ACEw\/s1600\/The%2BWhite%2BCompany%2BLaunch%2BA%2BCapsule%2BSkincare%2BCollection%2B%2528But%2BIs%2BIt%2BWorth%2BThe%2BPrice%2BTag%2529%2B%2B6.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EThe stripped back approach to skincare they've developed matches the brand aesthetic completely,\u0026nbsp; remaining in-keeping with their approach to everything from candles to bed throws. There's no fluff or faff, just a range of easy-to-use and incredibly beautiful formulas that will undoubtedly appeal to The White Company customers old and new; even the packaging is simple, elegant and timeless - ensuring that this appeals as much to a 25 year old as a 65 year old. Although the capsule collection is somewhat refreshing, it does mean if you want a more bespoke skincare regime or have specific needs that you'll need to look elsewhere - or at least add in a product or two from perhaps the standalone Deciem ranges. Let's take a closer look at each in turn... \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ldEqYc\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESUPER SERUM\u003C\/a\u003E £40.00\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EFeaturing  a blend of grape vine stem cells, protein-rich amino acids, green-tea  and marine extracts, this intelligent serum offers protection against UV  damage and ageing while also helping it to look plumper, smoother and  more even. This is probably my favourite from the range, as it's  incredibly light and more like an oil than a serum; my skin soaks it up  within a few seconds, leaving a pretty radiant complexion behind that's  ready for my moisturiser. It's a great all-rounder for all ages, but you  will need a touch more punch if you're wanting to tackle any bigger  issues than 'I just want to look after my skin.' \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2lK8UUJ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EADVANCED HYDRATION\u003C\/a\u003E £30.00 \u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBlended with an advanced form of hyaluronic acid, nourishing Amazonian oils and soothing aloe-vera butter, this lightweight moisturiser is non-greasy and absorbs quickly to leave skin feeling hydrated and comfortable. It's delicately scented with lavender, rose and orange essential oils to make the experience evocative (although the lavender puts me to sleep a little!) and luxurious, but despite that it's a relatively standard moisturiser. In my opinion the price is a little steep considering the amount of product you get, and the downside is that I'm a little disappointed there's no dressing-table appropriate pot. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2lKaA0G\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EEYE REVIVE\u003C\/a\u003E £20.00\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis ultra-light gel formula claims to diminish the appearance of dark circles, visibly reduce puffiness and helps to lift the upper eyelids. It's definitely cooling and pleasurable to apply, and thanks to a blend of Persian silk tree, oxygen-boosting actives and probiotic technology there's the possibility that it could actually brighten over time too - but again, it doesn't provide the immediate difference I look for and it's not amazing enough for me to stick with over a longer period of time.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ldyXAF\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESUPER BALM\u003C\/a\u003E £25.00\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EA cleansing balm that's designed to deeply, yet gently, cleanse and dissolve all traces of make-up while instantly boosting hydration, this is a great staple for anyone that needs a good cleanser at the end of a long day. It starts as a cream, melts into a lightweight balm upon contact with the skin, and then emulsifies when mixed with water to leave a creamy cleanse behind. You get a lot of product for your money too, making this a relatively affordable and effective option that I wouldn't think twice about recommending. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2lKlnb1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ENIGHT OIL\u003C\/a\u003E £30.00\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EFormulated with an enriching blend of Amazonian oils, anti-oxidants and poppy-flower extract to ensure that you'll awake with deeply nourished, super soft and firmer-looking skin, this night oil smells delicious and is a great texture for those nervous about applying oils. Although it's certainly pleasurable, I don't think there's anything groundbreaking going on here so you'll definitely be investing in more of a sensorial experience rather than hardcore skincare - but if that's your bag, you'll love it.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EOverall the range is great to use and provides a simple approach to skincare, but it's not rocking my world. I feel like you're definitely paying a premium for it being in White Company packaging, rather than for what's inside; my main concern with this range is the fact that partnering with Deciem means that you can get the same level of expertise and quality of ingredient from them directly - for a much cheaper price point. (The Ordinary starts at only a fiver, and if you know how to use it the range will be a life changer.) It's the perfect addition for the usual customer that pops into The White Company for a bathrobe or Christening gift and I completely understand why they've made this brand extension, but for those of us that expect great things from their skincare product it may be worth investing your cash elsewhere.

Having a healthy, radiant, powerful pout can mean the difference between feeling on top of the world and feeling like you'd rather stay in bed - that's why we're collectively so obsessed with the power of a great red lipstick! However, it's easy to become complacent when it comes to your lips (and neglect them in favour of anything from your under-eye circles to your cuticles,) as we don't often notice there's an issue until its too late. Whether that's dryness, irritation, lack of plumpness (or god forbid a coldsore!) by the time our bodies tell us somethings up we're forced to go into full-on war room mode; so what if there were things you could do to make a long-term difference, ensuring your pout was always preened and perfect? Here are five of my top tips to ensure your lips are healthy and kissable all year long.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-SEYPgWyMfYc\/WK2YtWKQ26I\/AAAAAAAAiuo\/VEMeDyzfc7Mcyx2FgB4LcITcurzewKW8QCLcB\/s1600\/How%2BTo%2BEnsure%2BHealthy%2BKissable%2BLips%2BAll%2BYear%2BLong%2B%2528While%2BPreventing%2BThose%2BCold%2BSores%2BFrom%2BAppearing%2521%2529%2B%2B7.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAPPLY LIPIVIR TO PREVENT COLD SORES\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EI've experienced my fair share of cold sores over the years and they're never fun. Once they've appeared they leave your lips uncomfortable, sore, crusty and visually a little bit bleugh - and most importantly, they prevent you from applying the products you want to use. Cold sores can zap your confidence and leave you wanting to hide away, but thankfully lipivir have created something to help. Applying a small amount around the edge of lips both morning and night can help prevent the appearance of cold sores, even up to that first tingle. The HSV1 virus that causes cold sores reactivates by sending signals between particles to ‘wake-up’ and start replicating so they can spread; lipivir has a special formulation that disrupts these signals so they don’t arrive. lts special formula is made of different polymers of ethylene glycol (a biologically\u0026nbsp;inactive substance which interferes with the signals) ‘jamming’ the viruses’ communications and preventing outbreaks. Clever eh? Pop it by your toothbrush so you remember to apply every time you brush your teeth!\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EUSE A SOOTHING LIP BALM\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EMany of the lipglosses and lipsticks we use are enriched with ingredients that can irritate or dry out the surface of lips; if you've ever applied a red lipstick multiple times in one day, you'll be very familiar with the sensation! Investing in a great lip balm that will help replenish lost moisture and inject goodness into the skin (through ingredients such as Vitamin E, coconut oil, beeswax or shea butter) will ensure you've always got a helping hand at your side. Pop one in your bag and on your desk so you can top up throughout the day.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBUFF THOSE LIPS ONCE A WEEK\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EExfoliating away a build-up of dry and dead skin cells will help rejuvinate the skin beneath, while encouraging blood to rise to the surface (providing a more youthful and plump appearance.) Whether you want to make your own scrub with a touch of sugar and coconut oil, or opt for a shop-bought version, make sure you buff the formula gently over lips once a week (or after you've been wearing lipstick) to leave your pout feeling fresh and smooth. Finish off with a dab of balm too soothe.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETREAT \u0026amp; PAMPER OVERNIGHT\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EJust like with our skin, our lips can benefit from a little overnight pampering. While our bodies are in 'go slow' mode they can focus more on repair, putting products to work effectively so you awake rejuvinated. Apply either a thick layer of your usual lip balm or moisturiser before bed, so it can work to soothe and hydrate as you slumber; if you're a regular lipstick wearer then this is also the perfect way to ensure your lips are always the perfect blank canvas ready to be painted. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EINVEST IN A HUMIDIFIER\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003ERather surprisingly, dry air can also dry out your lips - especially in the winter when the air can be dryer and our lips are exposed to cold winds. Investing in a humidifier to place in rooms where you spend a lot of time (such as your living room or bedroom) will help to infuse more moisture into the air; popping it on while you sleep will boost the performance of your products, while ensuring the delicate top layers are plumped full of moisture.

Historically skincare has always been the dull side of the beauty industry, with the focus very much being on game-changing makeup or instantly transformative haircare, but over the last decade our opinions have been transformed. As we collectively seek out ways to ensure our complexion remains radiant, healthy and strong throughout our lives (and the focus very much being on keeping those signs of ageing at bay for as long as possible,) skincare provides the tools we need to make a difference. Previous generations may have relied on soap, water and a little pot of cold cream, but now we’re turning to the most advanced science we can find - and integrating upwards of eight steps into our morning regime. Like with anything us consumers can get our hands on, the assumption is that ‘you get what you pay for’ and we should all be turning to super expensive lotions and skipping the budget potions altogether. However, if you know what to look for and how to shop your product portfolio doesn’t have to set you back the price of a designer handbag. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-IwY9cGp1PB0\/WK1wJxfF3rI\/AAAAAAAAitc\/ZB-F69SWBiEAOoPiYybekXlaeGh0LO6DgCLcB\/s1600\/Why%2BOwn%2BBrand%2BSkincare%2BIs%2BThe%2BSecret%2BAffordable%252C%2BYet%2BEffective%252C%2BOption%2BFor%2BAll%2BBudgets%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EOwn brand skincare has always had a bit of a reputation for being naff, ineffective and something you’d rather hide away in your bathroom; often the design of the packaging, marketing and information behind it doesn’t exactly help either. When presented with a relatively plain looking pack versus a super luxurious pot, which would you rather choose? However, often own branded skincare has been developed with the same science and within the same labs as some of the most expensive and aspirational brands - you just don’t pay the premium for that brand name and fancy pot. Unless a brand is part of a huge conglomerate, they tend to outsource their product development to other companies and utilise existing technology to develop the next ‘groundbreaking’ serum or face cream. (In fact Boots have a huge UK plant where they develop too many of the high street names to mention; you’d never know it was essentially all the same stuff unless you knew where to look!) \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhat’s interesting (and rather exciting) is that some of the ‘own brand’ skincare is therefore just as good as stuff that will set you back three times the price, because it’s developed in the same labs by the same people and often even produced in the same factories. The difference is that because that brand doesn’t have to pay themselves up to a 60% margin for the privilege of being sold in their stores (Boots\/Superdrug\/Tesco etc all buy in products at an average of 40% of the retail price, allowing themselves a tidy profit,) they can focus on creating the best product while keeping the price point down. That’s why Boots No7 is clinically proven to be so effective, but remains incredibly affordable; similarly, that’s why Superdrug’s own brand skincare is receiving increasing industry praise while often costing less than a tenner. Even brands including Avon and M\u0026amp;S have some beautiful products that really make a difference to skin, but you may never think to turn to them because of the perception you may have.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELike it’s become socially acceptable to hunt out a bargain or admit to buying that stellar dress from Matalan, the perception of own brand skincare is starting to change - which is great for both our complexions and our purses. If you look past the brand name and the (usually) rather dull packaging, you may find yourself a little gem that works just as hard as something super premium.

We reveled in being able to share our loves and loathes, provide honest feedback on our purchases and discuss issues that were important to us; opinions were at the heart of the bloggersphere and absolutely what made it stand out amongst the run-of-the-mill and diluted glossiness of magazines. Collectively we had turned against mainstream media as we couldn't necessarily trust the opinions and edits presented to us, especially when big brands and mega budgets were having an increasingly negative impact on the information between the covers. Bloggers were honest, transparent and not afraid to share exactly what they thought; a week didn't go by without one of us getting a 'cease and desist' letter from a brand that didn't like what we had to say, and were using their legal teams to scare us into censoring opinions. It was brilliant. It was wonderful. It was a turning point in time. Not everyone loved the same things or had the same opinions on a new launch, but that was ok - because that was a reflection of what was happening in the real world.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-m-1LVTmbi0o\/WKr_aF01QcI\/AAAAAAAAisk\/GLm5vFzlGNgNJGZkVZovCC1afrcv6nFGQCLcB\/s1600\/Beauty%2BPie%2BA%2BRevolutionary%2BNew%2BConcept%2BFor%2BMakeup%2BLovers%252C%2BBut%2BDoes%2BIt%2BMake%2BFinancial%2BSense%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EI like to refer to this as the 'golden age' of blogging: before it became as glossy, edited and mainstream as the media we were rebelling against. Over the last decade the bloggersphere has evolved (both positively and negatively) to the point that it's almost unrecogniseable from where we started; the editorial style of writing, fashion magazine standard photography and beautifully curated social media feeds that make every 20-something look like their living the life of Gigi Hadid are just the tip of the iceberg. The big issue? As a veteran of the blogging world I'm increasingly aware and concerned about the lack of real opinion - it's like the industry has become too scared to provide insight that's not 100% positive, or to share thoughts that aren't always 'on brand'. You can find literally thousands of cookie cutter blogs out there, but very few of them offer insight or comment beyond 'I love it!\/It's so pretty!\/This is a must-have!' \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWith the growth of the blogging community I understand that we're all in constant competition for the latest product sample, press trip or sponsored campaign (and that often playing it safe provides higher return in the short term.) I understand that brands want you to say nice things about their products, because their end objective is to make as many sales as possible. However, what I don't understand is why so many within the bloggersphere are happy to ride the safe train at the expense of their reader. In the words of Caroline Hirons during \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.carolinehirons.com\/2017\/02\/newness-updates-opinions.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ea recent post\u003C\/a\u003E: \u003Ci\u003E\"God forbid you say you didn’t get on with something. God forbid you use your platform to give your readers genuine feedback on an experience, even when it’s done so constructively and without resorting to blanket negativity. Having an opinion does not make you a bitch, and it certainly should not make you ashamed.\" \u003C\/i\u003EAmen Hirons, amen.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe digital space has successfully evolved into something aspirational, motivational and incredibly curated, but in my opinion this has been at the expense of raw and unedited opinion - which is why we all started in the first place. We're on very dangerous ground right now as blogs become increasingly fluffy and bland. I find myself continually fighting to be recognised as an intelligent woman with a well-rounded background and informed opinion, but when there are so many others out there focusing on the prettiness of their online space rather than what impact their words have, it becomes somewhat of a losing battle. Super styled beauty images, professionally shot outfits and hired locations that wouldn't look out of place on the pages of Vogue are great, but it's also important for us to use the power of the written (or spoken) word to make positive change or share valuable opinion. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs an example, recently a new beauty concept launched into the UK under the name of 'Beauty Pie'; this subscription platform seemed great on the surface, but when you started to scratch away and look deeper there were a number of issues and problematic areas that needed addressing as part of a comprehensive review. (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2016\/12\/beauty-pie-revolutionary-new-concept.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EYou can read my full feature here\u003C\/a\u003E.) What concerned me was the number of features that praised the service as something revolutionary and overwhelmingly positive, without letting readers know about the potential pitfalls (of which there were many.) I've literally read hundreds of articles on the concept, but could probably count on my hands the number of sites that dared to say anything negative (or worse, even bothered to do their own research rather than just repeating what was on the press release.) Everyone is free to give their opinion and share their own thoughts (positive, negative or neutral) because that's the whole point of the bloggersphere, but when there's no opinion at all? That's when it becomes worrying.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI feel incredibly uneasy about the future of blogging right now, because I think we're in serious danger of becoming as edited and vacuous as the magazines that we're supposed to be replacing. Too many are focused on whether everything is 'on brand' for them, rather than using their voice and influence to impart knowledge or advice; too many are worried about losing out on that next press trip or bundle of free lipsticks, rather than focusing on creating a strong persona that their readers can relate to. Too many of us are being shot down for having an opinion or told that we should just get back to talking about lipsticks, while the blogging elite are focused on their next big pay rather than whether they would genuinely recommend a product without it. I've always made it a priority to share my true thoughts and bring you an honest account of my experiences; a great brand will understand that not everyone will adore every product, and a reader won't expect you to. Opinions are vital to the bloggersphere and how it operates, but they seem to now be as rare as a limited edition Mariah Carey lipstick. I think it's about time we brought them back...\u003Cbr \/\u003EBut you know, that's just my opinion. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003EWhat do you think about the scarcity of opinions within the bloggersphere right now?

I like it a lot. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-K1XjG65OsyE\/WKcNELL_TuI\/AAAAAAAAiqc\/iVrvNqwG_gYUP09CI2wQ4mpFZrw8BZUMgCEw\/s1600\/new%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2B2.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHave you got your eye on any of my ten current faves?

The original was released back in 1991 when I was barely nine years old, but I can still remember the songs practically word-for-world and continue to dream of having a dress as beautiful (and yellow) as Belle's in that classic scene; there's something about the emotion that's attached to such a tale that still puts a smile on my face. Skip forward over 25 years and this iconic story is about to get a new lease of live via the live action version, starring our very own Hermoine Granger. (My inner Potter-nerd is probably happier about that than it should be.) It's not even due to hit cinemas for another month, but the merchandise has already started to go into overdrive to tickle our tastebuds and get us in the mood for the big event. Although I may be too old for plastic dolls and princess dresses, I'm definitely not past the stage of wanting a piece of Beauty and the Beast lipstick - so when I discovered that L'Oreal were launching a 14-piece collection to celebrate the launch, I almost peed myself with excitement. The only downside is that it's exclusively available in Italy, but thanks to an Amazon Prime account I was able to buy it and ship the collection over in a couple of days!

That works out about £6.40 each, with the bonus that they're all packed in a special edition keepsake box; they're not cheap, but together it's not insanely expensive if you're obsessed with the film franchise or just simply want a piece of makeup history. Each of the main characters each have their own lipstick and polish (including Belle, Beast, Mrs Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere, the featherduster and the rose) which are adorned with designs that correspond to their character. Unfortunately the designs aren't printed onto the packaging itself, but instead are stickers that have been applied over the top; I can only assume that this is why the range hasn't been brought over to the UK, as it's not the same standard we're used to seeing from L'Oreal (even if the stickers are good quality and textured, as well as featuring embossed metallic touches.) Nevertheless, the overall effect is somewhat magical and definitely makes me feel like this is something to be treasured for years to come.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-ZiuxhYHgJaY\/WKRtx7CWasI\/AAAAAAAAiok\/i2u9ZyExzSgqyvXggo68AsouNCJ_3PTDQCLcB\/s1600\/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B17.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-0F7kJM5keb0\/WKRsJtmJyAI\/AAAAAAAAioA\/uYgWA2_3Fc8WPBU5cPMan9oO7pjbM_wOgCLcB\/s1600\/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B12.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-cRy-yD_GfXI\/WKRsMoB_TNI\/AAAAAAAAioE\/1wnCnurxqbs_2ScipetPVF-cS8y6kpcZQCLcB\/s1600\/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B13.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe collection includes a number of bold shades, including a classic red and power pink, alongside a more wearable chocolate brown and nude tone. I would've liked to see more of a spectrum (there feels like there's a lot of red, perhaps because of the Italian market?) but they're all very wearable and universal in appeal - just like the nail polishes. (That navy blue!) Personally I don't get why the Cogsworth products aren't a beautiful brown colour, nor why there's a very random featherduster (not a main character in my opinion) and slightly tacky lipstick mark design, but the rest of the range definitely leaves me feeling pleased with my purchase. Thankfully the box everything is held in absolutely met my expectations, providing a covetable and great quality outer in which to store the makeup items within (because you know these aren't meant to be actually used!) I do wish that there were token limited edition Beauty and the Beast lipsticks and polishes available in the UK, especially because the rose version is so pretty, but alas... Maybe the fact you can't get hold of them makes it all the more lustworthy?

There are so many beauty rules and regulations set by the media (including us bloggers!) but realistically none of us will ever be able to follow them to the letter - be it time, energy, understanding or finances preventing us from doing so. Although there are certain things I would recommend either avoiding or adopting, there's also a tonne of stuff that's really not worth getting in a flap over; you're not going to ruin your body if you skip a step, forget to take off your makeup effectively or use a touch of sulphate-enriched shampoo on your head, but it is important to be aware and informed so you can choose what's right for you. Here are the eight 'mistakes' many of us make, and why you shouldn't get in a flap over them.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-4DwFz0m922s\/WKRE00c7feI\/AAAAAAAAinM\/97TfK1houJsvY7KtH70tMG8eohPUZGFOgCLcB\/s1600\/Don%2527t%2BWorry%2BAbout%2BIt%2B8%2BBeauty%2B%2527Mistakes%2527%2BYou%2BShouldn%2527t%2BBe%2BGetting%2BIn%2BA%2BFlap%2BOver%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1.

I understand that adding four layers beneath your makeup can cause more problems than it helps if you don't get it right (the key is to only apply a touch and not coat your face in a light layer of goo,) so if you feel like serum or eye cream isn't for you then that's cool. Just make sure you have a regime that works for your needs.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2.

Although they will only ever remove the top layer of makeup and offer nothing in the way of a deep cleanse, something is better than nothing. Just don't make it a regular occurrence as the alcohol can dry out skin, while the remaining grime on your face will inevitably cause breakouts.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E3.

If you wear heavy makeup and\/or SPF you should definitely be cleansing twice in the evening to ensure your complexion is squeaky clean, but if you suffer with dryness or irritation, wear only a little or no makeup, or simply have a tendency to over scrub, then a singular cleanse may be all you need. If you're prone to breakouts, acne or rosacea, then definitely stick to a gentle single cleanse.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E4.

I'm sure we're all guilty of using our appliances on the hottest setting, but the most important thing is you apply a heat protection spray so you don't burn off your tresses - and that you regularly embrace putting down the tools. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E5. USING TOO MUCH DRY SHAMPOO\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EDry shampoos are designed to draw out moisture from the hair and scalp, removing the 'lank' feeling that can often occur between washes; however, when overused they can actually remove too much moisture.

Rather than ditching it or feeling guilty, opt for a lighter and more natural version that won't clog the hair follicles - your head will be happy, plus you can get those extra minutes in bed. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E6.

We're told we should always use a base coat in order to provide protection and help to strengthen the nail, but in my experience it really doesn't make that much difference - especially now many polishes are enriched with ingredients that are supposed to offer a base coat effect anyway. Take my advice and skip this extra step in favour of applying a top coat; at least that may help with longevity!\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E7.

Although it is better for your hair to apply to the roots for the majority of the time, topping up the rest of your locks in the last few minutes, realistically you won't overly damage your barnet by chucking on more dye - especially when most of the time it's already saturated with the same colour.

Adding a powerful pout to an otherwise low key outfit can perk you up and help you to look 'finished', while a glide of an understated nude shade just helps to convey that feeling of effortless elegance. However, there is a downside to wearing a touch of lippie: my lips tend to become dry, uncomfortable and unable to take more than a second layer of colour. Last week I wore a fabulous Kat Von D number in a statement red shade, but after a few hours the colour had bled and my lips were feeling dryer than the dessert during a heatwave; what looks great when you step out the door doesn't always keep feeling fab when you just want to go about your business. Burt's Bees have always been a brand I've had a lot of love for (and probably the brand I'm most loyal to, simply because their lipbalms are in every pocket, drawer and handbag in my life) because their formulations are full of goodness while ensuring such a comfortable finish. They've dabbled in colour before with the launch of their lip crayons (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2016\/05\/youll-eat-1000-lipsticks-in-your.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ewhich I loved and wrote about here\u003C\/a\u003E,) but this springtime they're taking that one step further with the launch of full on \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2kZ9f3M\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Elipsticks\u003C\/a\u003E in 18 covetable shades - all of which provide fabulous pigment and a super comfortable finish.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/--xrLOuI5iq0\/WKGufhEoikI\/AAAAAAAAikE\/IrJdwfe2BkILCwQOooA0IFoETgqx3X-AACEw\/s1600\/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B%2B5.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EHoused in cute bee-inspired packaging, these bullets provide full coverage and vibrant colour with up to eight hours of colour (although I'd like to find anyone that's able to make their lipsticks last for eight hours - maybe they don't talk or eat for a full day?!) Like the rest of the Burt's Bees range, these are 100% natural (but not organic) and are bursting with tasty ingredients including beeswax, Vitamin E, Moringa and Raspberry Seed Oils to help condition your lips all day long. What you will notice when you apply these is that they feel like a beautiful nourishing balm, not a drying lipstick; they glide over lips with ease to deposit a beautiful colour result in shades that range from the perfect pink and nudes, to the bold berry tones and classic reds.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI have noticed that with the darker and more statement shades it's worth buffing your lips throroughly to remove any dry skin, as for some reason the formula can clump around dry patches and look a bit inconsistent; similarly, it's worth applying the darker tones with a lip brush rather than straight from the bullet, as they can appear a bit patchy. Although the packaging for me does cheapen the overall look and feel of the lipsticks, it is made of 100% recycled plastic and can be recycled after use too... So I suppose that outweighs the need for something super premium and aesthetically pleasing. It still does the job, and I love the little coloured honeycomb holes, but I would have liked just a touch more material to make it feel a bit sturdier.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EFor £9.99 they're a great little buy and one I know I'll be reaching for a lot when I want my colour to last without getting the fear that re-applying will dry out my lips for days.

Us beauty bloggers have undoubtedly been fueling the trend, promising readers that the latest eyeshadow palette to land on our doorstep is a brilliant copy of something four times the price, but the market has also been driven by technological improvements that allow us to buy into the same quality for a fraction of the previous cost. When I was growing up the only 'budget' beauty brands were Collection 2000 and Boots 17, both offering a plethora of products to get experimental with but the quality wasn't there; as soon as we could upgrade to something a touch more glamorous, we would. Skip forward a few decades and those (rebranded) names are not only offering far superior quality and in some instances competing with some of the most luxury cosmetics available, but our high streets have been somewhat revolutionised. Names including MUA, Makeup Revolution, Lottie London, NYX, Freedom, GOSH, Miss Sporty, Model's Own and Sleek are proving that you don't have to spend a fortune to fill your makeup bag with greatness - but they're also collectively providing us with dupes of everything from Urban Decay Naked palettes and Kylie liquid lipsticks, to NARS blushers and Bobbi Brown highlighters. For a moment there we got a bit excited, but are we over it? Is 2017 the year that we're finally bored of the dupe and we start trading up for something we can treasure? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-Yc1ntGb8TEs\/WJniMNVmygI\/AAAAAAAAiiI\/ZTV7Mxl_IvwWJdRPJ5QdzOWIV66mBDprgCLcB\/s1600\/Is%2BThe%2BDupe%2B%2526%2BCopycat%2BBeauty%2BMarket%2BWaning%2BAre%2BWe%2BOver%2BCheaper%2BCopies%2BOf%2BFirm%2BFavourites%2B3.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EIn my opinion the growth of our dupe fascination came with the rise in popularity of throwaway fashion and being able to snap up something on-trend for the price of your morning coffee. Primark allowed us to update last year's jumper with the help of a £2.50 statement necklace, or pick up a pair of pumps for £4.00 during our lunchbreak; we became obsessed with buying all the fashion and always having something new to adorn our bodies with, as for the first time ever fashion became insanely affordable. It became the norm to buy a new outfit for every night out, because we didn't have to break our backs to do so; it became pretty standardised to pick up a Mulberry or Chloe copy from New Look or Topshop as the high street tried to capture our attention in new and exciting ways. Unsurprisingly this filtered pretty quickly into the beauty industry, with consumers always wanting to hunt down that must-have product without having to fork out the full price.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESome brands have built their entire business models off the back of dupes, even taking the time to ensure their packaging is 'inspired' by their more expensive counterparts. Makeup Revolution, Barry M, Sleek, W7 and The Balm are some of the worst (or best) culprits, being able to turn around a new product and offer up a dupe sometimes within a few months of the original hitting shelves. Others take a softer approach, preferring to identify trends (nude eyeshadow palettes, liquid lipsticks and finely milled pigmented blushers) and create their own take without stepping on any toes. Up until this point they've benefited from a huge surge in consumer interest (fueled by bloggers knowing that anything considered a dupe will bring in those much needed hits!) but my gut feeling is that this is coming to an end. Although picking up a cut price item of makeup will give us a buzz, if it just doesn't perform or feel like the original would we be better off saving our pennies and splurging on products we know we'll thoroughly enjoy from beginning to end?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI love brands like Makeup Revolution, but I can't help but feel like they need to step out of the dupe arena and create something new. Endless tweaks on the same product get a little dull, while a stand full of copycats makes me feel like they lack the creativity consumers are beginning to expect. Just as I've moved away from fast fashion, I'm also moving away from fast beauty; I would far prefer to spend £20.00 on something I know produces the results I need than impulsively chuck a few pounds on something ten times over that never gets used. Although the quality of affordable makeup is so much better than it ever has been, I do feel that as a society we're moving towards more considered purchasing and are starting to make wise investments less often - rather than feeling the need to snap up anything and everything because it's cheap.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EPersonally I adore affordable beauty and I know you do too; I know you love to find out what's exciting and what bargain buys are worth snapping up, but it's all about balance. I know you also  want to know what's worth spending your money on and making informed decisions about those purchases. Although I don't think these affordable brands are going anywhere, I do feel that this year there will be a move away from creating copies and dupes - towards real innovation that stands on its own two feet. Brands including Kiko, NYX and Bourjois are creating covetable pieces (at affordable prices) without feeling the need to copy or imitate, to the point where they're sure to become cult classics themselves; with the technological advances and birth of the internet allowing practically anyone to set up shop and ship worldwide, there's no excuse to remain stagnant or just copy what everyone else is doing. Us consumers demand more, but brands are you listening? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhat do you think about dupes and copycat brands?

About 18 months ago I started to make a concerted effort to connect with other bloggers that were also feeling a bit out of the loop and almost 'too old' for this digital game, but quickly it became clear that we were collectively smashing it out of the park and proving that blogging really isn't just for the teens.

I've been blogging for nearly seven years and during that time I've evolved as a woman, but also as a content creator; I'm not afraid to be exactly who I am, share my opinions and put myself out there as an imperfect specimen of Twenty-First-Century-Life. Although I wish I lived in an all-white apartment and had a perfect figure, I know that I'm more than that - and I'm proud of it. I'm a 34 year old who is passionate about politics, self-acceptance and emotional wellbeing; I care about making positive change, I'm not afraid of calling people out when I think they're acting unethically and I can deal with the fall-out when it undoubtedly comes. It's all water off a ducks back to me, which makes me even more passionate about sharing my thoughts and opinions. There's no dumbing down or avoiding hot topics on here! \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMY EXPERIENCES ARE WELL ROUNDED\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EThis time ten years ago I can tell you that I was self-absorbed, self-critical and had very little perspective on the world around me. Experiences provide you with benchmarks from which to base opinions and actions, as well as proving that you're not the centre of the universe; not everything is about you personally and a different opinion doesn't mean that you're unlikeable - debate is healthy and should be actively encouraged. Experience comes with age and experiences are the lifeblood of any digital space - without them it quickly becomes a very dry and one dimensional space. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EI KNOW A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EGenerally speaking, the longer you've lived the more you pick up from experience. As a result I know a lot about the beauty industry, how it works behind the scenes, what ingredients are must-haves, the trends that are around the corner, which new launches are actually just re-hashes from ten years ago and what is actually genuine innovation. Over the last thirteen years I've worked on a multitude of brands and been responsible for everything from in-store marketing and television campaigns, to social strategy and digital media; this exposure gives me a great perspective and allows me to share that with you guys to in turn help you increase your knowledge and understanding. In my opinion that's far more valuable insight than a nineteen year old saying \"ooooh pretty\" at everything that lands on their doorstep - and why I religiously read blogs such as \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/britishbeautyblogger.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBritish Beauty Blogger\u003C\/a\u003E. (Her knowledge of the industry is insane.) \u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWE NEED TO SEE MORE DIVERSITY\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EI for one am increasingly bored of seeing the same bloggers time and time and again being held up as the ultimate in digital creators. They're always twenty-something, white, middle class, beautiful and carrying a designer handbag - but the beauty of the bloggersphere is that we come in all shapes, sizes, colours and ages. Some of my fave blogs right now include \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.daniellevanier.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EDanielle Vanier\u003C\/a\u003E for her plus sized sass, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/adorngirl.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAdorn Girl\u003C\/a\u003E for her beautiful photography and insight, as well as \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/fashionforlunch.net\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EFashion For Lunch\u003C\/a\u003E for her colour-filled playfulness. (It helps they're all championing the 30+ age group too!) There are so many incredible women out there doing incredible things, but if they don't fit the traditional mould they're practically invisible; I'm making an effort to show there is more than one type of blogger out there by putting more of myself on here (you may have noticed much more of my face of late!) and the reception has been so positive. It just proves we want to see something fresh and a tad more relatable than what we're being spoon-fed by the media. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EI CAN TALK ABOUT PRESSING ISSUES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EBeing confident in yourself means that discussing mental health, smear tests, feminine hygiene and dealing with putting on weight (amongst a tonne of other things) isn't as scary or 'off brand'.

Being older and (somewhat) wiser also means I can feel confident in sharing opinions, insights and commentary on current events and not being afraid of using my influence for more than just pushing a new face cream. Collectively this makes it far more exciting to write, and hopefully far more exciting to read; whether that's being a feminist, attending your smear tests or discussing bought Instagram followers, I'm not afraid to start a conversation. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003EI'm really excited about the year ahead, and discovering some more amazing 30+ bloggers, so I hope you'll be on that journey with me - whether you're 23 or 83. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca class=\"bloglovin-widget\" data-blog-id=\"2158708\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/2158708\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/madmimi.com\/signups\/147076\/join\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003E \u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

I'm a big fan of the wing, but it's taken me an age to pick up the skills required to make it half decent: get the angle wrong, the length too big or the symmetry completely wonky and it's all ruined. How many mornings have you spent trying to even out your liner in the mirror, just for the whole look to keep getting bigger and bigger until you resemble a Winehouse tribute act? Well, if that's a common issue for you then you simply NEED this little gadget from Beauty Blender in your life - because, *dramatic voice* let me assure you, it will change it. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-HZAvvvgVTf0\/WJOB0OnkmzI\/AAAAAAAAigg\/yhZ-ToJxeG85HES3GMJquwQ_bzPgN8zcgCEw\/s1600\/Beauty%2BBlender%2BLiner%2BDesigner%2B6.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EThis unassuming little rubber triangle (rather fetchingly called \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2l0WVi3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBeauty Blender Liner Designer\u003C\/a\u003E and looks closer to a guitar pick than I'd probably like,) can be placed along the base of the lower lid to create the perfect angle for your flick. You simply place it where you need it to go and draw along the edge using your eyeliner pen, paying attention to the length of the flick; because of the texture and material it's impossible for it to bleed or smudge, leaving behind a clean and sharp line that's incomparable to what I can achieve freehand. Replicate this on the other side, using the line you've already drawn and the residue on the tool (you can see the line on the edge, so you can use that as a guide on the other eye!) to create the most symmetrical pair of wings you'll have ever seen.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlthough it's a little flimsy piece of plastic, it does come in a case to prevent it from getting dirty or lost - which also features a handy mirror if you need to use one on the go. The Liner Designer is easy to wash by running it under the sink or cleaning with a face wipe, ensuring it's reusable and probably going to last you for as long as you can find it. At £10.00 it does seem expensive for a little triangle of rubber, but the idea and ease of use makes it thoroughly worth that crisp ten pound note; I honestly don't know how I used to create flicks without this! If you're feeling thrifty you could probably create your own or find one on eBay for a fraction of the price, but I'm all over this like a rash.

Most of the perfumes in my collection are from brands including Jo Malone, Shay \u0026amp; Blue and Miller Harris - although there's also a sprinkling of fashion brands (including Chanel, YSL, Burberry and Chloe) to keep my reportoire current, on-trend and also elegant. Generally speaking I bypass anything that's too 'high street' or 'celebrity' and anything that's pink and sparkly, mainly because they're either too sweet or too floral for my personal tastes. That's not to say they don't have value, but they're usually not my cup of tea.

I've always had a bit of a love\/hate  relationship with the brand in general - it reminded me of my university  days, Paris Hilton, watching Legally Blonde on repeat and feeling like a  walking fake tan advert. (How times have changed eh!) Their fragrances  have always been incredibly successful, but as a 34 year old woman I  thought my days of Juicy Couture were well and truly over. Despite that,  they come along and launch \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2jHzl91\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EViva La Juicy Sucré\u003C\/a\u003E and prove that you're never too old for a touch of OTT bling and a spritz of something sparkling. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis  latest incarnation in the Juicy fragrance franchise takes inspiration  'from the Viva girl’s playful personality' and provides \"an irresistible  confection of delectable fruits and sweet florals, which flirt with  warm vanilla and sensual sandalwood.\" Unlike the other fragrances in the  collection, this is fresher and more citrus, providing a more mature  twist on sweetness while still keeping it lighthearted and fun. (You can  tell that from the bottle alone: a drizzle of icing sugar sits on top,  while the base sits within a golden cake case!) The scent opens with the  fresh fruity notes of sparkling mandarin, juicy red currant and  gardenia for a feminine edge; at the heart, orange flower and jasmine  blossom are mixed with peach nectar and finished with almond cream; the  base notes of vanilla extract and sandalwood provide a creamy warmth alongside crushed cocoa beans.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI was all ready to sniff this and feel a little overwhelmed (I actually packed headache tablets for the launch event, just in case!) but as soon as I breathed it in my nostrils relaxed and appreciated the uplifting notes for what they offered. Although this is sweet, it's not sugary sweet; the fruity notes and sandalwood ensure the sweetness of the vanilla and cocoa is kept secondary to something all the more wearable. Although the rather extravagant marketing campaign is all about sugar overload, don't let that put you off having a sniff for yourself; although the juice nods to sweetness, the composition is more like a yummy cake with a touch of sugar on top than a box of chocolate you immediately devour. It may not be something I reach for daily, but it's definitely something I could learn to love over time.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhether you're obsessed with sweet scents, love the rest of the Juicy fragrances or simply want to explore Viva La Juicy Sucré for yourself, then you can get your hands on it right now.

This winter I've been embracing the jumper dress for the first time ever and I have to say I'm all over it: they're cosy and comfy without requiring any kind of effort, but look like you've actually put a little thought into your attire. Although this little number from Next is one of my current faves, the colour means I feel the need to up-the-outfit-ante with a rather delicious looking handbag that will make me feel like a boss (even though I'm secretly wishing it to be nap time.)

However, when I popped by Bicester Village and saw it  on sale it was hard to resist - so much so I went back to the shop a  couple times to try it on and see if I was really that in love with it.  (Spoiler, I was.) This is why I love Bicester Village: you can pick up  items you coveted at full price on the catwalk for sometimes less than  half the price a few months later, while still enjoying that designer  shopping experience. (FYI I got this for about a third off the usual retail price, and in black! Unheard of!) It looks utterly divine and is large enough for everything I  need, while the chunky zip and studded details give it a modern edge. It's just what I needed to spice up an otherwise bland outfit and help me forget about the frizzy mop on my head caused by the day's drizzle.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-umUuVmaxp80\/WJC-DB4P94I\/AAAAAAAAidg\/FZA1Qz69f44fw9jyGTlMQUar0tCtl1iUQCEw\/s1600\/Miserable%2BWeather%252C%2BCoffee%2BDates%2B%2526%2BNew%2BHandbags%2B%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-jT2gaBYUMH4\/WJC-EQIMyvI\/AAAAAAAAidg\/mgBQsM51yJkmmZP18JCZdcmpN-3LnEnkwCEw\/s1600\/Miserable%2BWeather%252C%2BCoffee%2BDates%2B%2526%2BNew%2BHandbags%2B%2B6.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-r61j6l8lQnQ\/WJC97YIlaiI\/AAAAAAAAidg\/FUNGjEWPpsgPlsBbErUQ5Azs6SAVNlD-QCEw\/s1600\/Coffee%2BDates%2B%2526%2BNew%2BHandbags%2B%2B4.png\" \/\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: justify;\"\u003EAs for the watch, this is also my new obsession. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.henry-london.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EHenry London\u003C\/a\u003E have a huge number of different designs and colour-ways that  ensure your arm candy has a little twist; I kept things simple by  choosing a white strap and face (it goes with more than black, believe  it or not!) and matching the metal details with my current rose gold jewellery obsession.

On one hand I'm embracing the changes the years bring and celebrate the fact I'm older, wiser and more confident than I ever have been, but on the other hand I feel my youth slipping away one fine line at a time. I don't want to look like a teenager again, but the onset of deep wrinkles really quite worries me at this stage in my life (I'm sure I'll come to love them as they appear later down the line!) Anything I can do to delay the onset of the ageing process, make my skin more radiant and reduce the appearance of those little crinkles, I will - within reason. Personally things like botox and seriously invasive procedures just aren't quite me, but give me any lotion or potion and I'll slap it on happily with the aim of reducing those signs I see every day in the mirror. My skincare regime is expansive and I invest a lot of time massaging in expensive creams and taking my supplements, but that doesn't mean there isn't always something more effective and somewhat revolutionary around the corner.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-UcgbHIDPV7s\/WI8bQ4ngbEI\/AAAAAAAAicI\/ifHteUF7OU4lk7gyaxo36I_3qaFjQbX3QCLcB\/s1600\/Can%2BYou%2BReally%2BLook%2B10%2BYears%2BYounger%2BWhy%2BCeramide%2BCapsules%2BAre%2BNow%2BA%2BStaple%2BIn%2BMy%2BRegime%2B3.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EElizabeth Arden's \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2kJEd2j\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ECeramide Capsules\u003C\/a\u003E were launched in 1990 and have become a global best seller. This bio-engineered, skin-identical ceramide formula was available in a first-of–its-kind single-dose capsule format, removing the need for preservatives and making skincare incredibly portable. If you're wondering what Ceramides are, then essentially these precious lipids form up to 50% of the skin's moisture barrier and help to keep our complexions looking youthful; they're the 'cement' that holds your skin cells together, creating a smooth and radiant surface. Inevitably the level of these Ceramides significantly drops as we age; although historically it was thought this didn't happen until the later years, increasing research has shown the decline in quantity starts from when we hit thirty. (You will have lost about 40% of your skin’s ceramides by your 30s, and more than 60% by your 40s. Ouch.) This decrease in essential lipids causes skin to appear dry, dull and can result in wrinkles, unevenness and loss of firmness - all the signs we try so hard to counteract. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ECan you believe that the science bods behind Elizabeth Arden were the ones to first discover and harness the power of Ceramides? So much so that they trademarked the name! The original Ceramide Capsules were incredibly popular because they worked; they contained a combination of oils and lipids to help nourish the skin while plumping the surface for a smoother and more radiant glow. In celebration of 25 years of the capsules, Elizabeth Arden are re-launching them with a new and improved formula that offers triple the power of the original. When used daily, they can enhance skin’s barrier repair function, increase moisturisation within  the surface of the skin and minimise the appearance of fine lines and  wrinkles.That's what I'm talking about! So what's in these little gold capsules that makes them so special? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EFatty Acids\u003C\/b\u003E (including Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid and Vitamin E) help maintain the integrity of the skin’s lipid barrier for healthy-looking skin; \u003Cb\u003ECholesterol\u003C\/b\u003E helps retain moisture levels to support the stratum corneum and help protect skin from dehydration; \u003Cb\u003EPhytosphingosine\u003C\/b\u003E, a lipid naturally found in the skin, allows and encourages the skin itself to produce the ceramides it needs; \u003Cb\u003ESea Fennel Extract\u003C\/b\u003E helps to enhance skin cell renewal as well as increase luminosity and skin smoothness; a \u003Cb\u003EBotanical Complex\u003C\/b\u003E features Alfalfa Extract, lipids from olives and hydrocarbons from coconut oil to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, increase hydration levels and soothe skin;\u003Cb\u003E Tsubaki Oil \u003C\/b\u003Eis rich in Oleic Acid, Vitamins A, B, D \u0026amp; E, and nourishing Omegas 3, 6 \u0026amp; 9, so has been added to help improve elasticity, minimise the look of fine lines and wrinkles while enhancing moisture for smooth, supple skin; and finally \u003Cb\u003ERetinyl Palmitate\u003C\/b\u003E is a Vitamin A derivative that works to support skin’s own natural collagen for a firmer look.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThat's a lot of power in one little dose. Most 'anti ageing' formulas focus on hydration via hylaronic acid, increasing cell turnover for brightness and improved texture or encouragning collagen production; these capsules are full of so much more and actually help to re-build the skin from within. I've always been aware of these iconic capsules, but I made the (incorrect) assumption that they were targeted at 40 or 50+ skin rather than being able to meet my changing 30+ needs. After getting to know the science and evidence behind the skincare, I'm confident that this is what I need to take my skincare regime to the next level and help fend off those fine lines a little longer. I love the fact they're portable (no more lugging huge bottles of serum away with me) and easy to integrate into my routine (they don't have to replace anything but can just boost your existing products - I use after Elizabeth Arden SuperStart and before my usual moisturiser) even if they are a little expensive (roughly about £1.00 a capsule depending how many you buy at once.)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe texture is like a very lightweight non-greasy oil that glides over skin and absorbs pretty quickly to leave the surface feeling instantly smoother and more radiant; I've only been using these for a couple of weeks but I'm already hooked. I've yet to look 25 again, but with ongoing use I've no doubt I can certainly look my best. And as for the ten years younger claim? The capsules have been proven to take up to 10 years off the look of skin, based on a clinical study of 44 women aged 36-64 after 12 weeks of use. (They did this by measuring the characteristics of skin before and after the study, known to occur during certain decades; so much were the results, that many moved from one decade characterisation to the previous in only a few months!) In addition to this, 100% of women in the study showed an improvement in the overall appearance of their skin and 95% demonstrated a significant improvement in visible firmness after just two weeks.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EA lot of brands try to make incredible claims or sell you pots of stuff you don't need off the back of falsehoods, but in this instance I've seen the data and the corresponding images - and millions of women around the globe can't be wrong. I'm slapping these on my face like there's no tomorrow and can't see that changing any time soon; who knew a little golden capsule could make such a big impact?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHave you ever used these golden capsules?

It's all about how many followers you've got on Instagram, what your Klout score is and the number of YouTube views each video gets. I get it, I really do; brands want to generate as much exposure as they possibly can and to get maximum return on their investment, so the number of eyeballs is the easiest thing to focus on. When historically we've all only had magazine circulation figures (often hugely inflated or manipulated) to go on, this is the one statistic that keeps being measured as the ultimate level of success - and expectations keep increasing. With some superstar bloggers and vloggers speaking to millions of people every single month, it's easy to get wrapped up in seeking as high a number as possible and using that as the only metric of success. However, this numbers-led culture within the bloggersphere is causing one huge problem that seems to be getting increasingly worse: bought followers.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-WCzJNm2rb3U\/WItydg8J4oI\/AAAAAAAAibg\/5VJZij988mEzVYWpMjT2SGFIktwQazJCgCLcB\/s1600\/It%2527s%2BA%2BLying%2BShame.%2BFake%2BFollowers%2BAre%2BOn%2BThe%2BIncrease%2B%2528And%2B20%2BOf%2BPRs%2BDon%2527t%2BCare%2529%2B%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EIt's surprisingly easy (and cheap) to buy your way to the top these days. All it takes is a couple of quid, a few minutes out of your day and BOOM you've got yourself another couple of thousand Instagram followers. The platforms that offer these services are becoming increasingly savvy, ensuring their fake accounts look and feel like real ones - they have real names, real faces and real photos on their own feeds, but if you look a little harder you start to see through the illusion. What's even more worrying is that these falsified accounts aren't just appearing on little known blogger's feeds, but on some of the most well known and respected in the industry; even one of the biggest UK beauty editors is well known for buying her way to 100k Instagram followers and as a result is heralded in the press as one of the best beauty insiders on social media. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003EAlthough that's a problem in itself (lies always get caught out in the end,) what I find increasingly worrying is the number of brands, PRs and industry insiders that know about these falsified audiences and continue to work with the bloggers regardless. I've had conversations with a handful of brand representatives myself about the issue and have been met with shrugged shoulders, only for them to book the influencer in question for a big campaign a few weeks later. I was worried and baffled: was I the only one thinking it was unethical to buy your way to the top, ask for money to be part of a campaign only for your audience to be significantly non-existent? As a result you may have seen the poll I ran a couple of weeks ago on Twitter (\u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LBQblog\/status\/819159958411497472\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Esee the poll here,\u003C\/a\u003E) which asked the question: \u003Ci\u003E\"Do you care if (you suspect) a blogger has bought their social followers?\"\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe result was this: unsuprisingly 85% of the bloggers who answered said they did, with the remaining 15% not caring at all. (I get it: you may just like their content and don't give a rats arse what's going on with their following, real or otherwise. In fact some of the bloggers suspected to have hugely falsified followings are actual incredible content creators - which makes it even more frustrating.) However, 160 PRs answered my poll and around 20% of them admitted they didn't care if they knew or suspected an influencer had bought their followers. That means that around 20% of my sample study knowingly work with bloggers, vloggers or social media starts that they suspect or know to have a fake following. And do not care. Let’s just reiterate that once again: they do not care. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMy problem with this is two fold: 1. that brands are being fed information on bloggers that is one-dimensional, inflated and inaccurate, so their ongoing expectations are distorted, and 2. that the bloggers in question are often charging a small fortune, getting the great campaigns and taking work away from other people that are working to build a true and authentic audience. When it’s no longer a free lipstick or invitation to a cocktail reception, and instead exotic holidays, designer handbags and campaigns that see their faces plastered over billboards and in stores nationwide, it’s time to start saying this is not ok. It's all very well and good to ignore it or think \"don't worry, they'll get caught out in the end!\" or \"cheaters never get ahead!\" But the problem is they are; they're getting ahead and they're getting ahead at the expense of everyone else. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMy thoughts are somewhat torn on who is to blame for this current situation and who is making it worse. As bloggers we’re always being driven to justify why a brand should want to work with us, and those conversations 99% of the time focus on numbers; very few discussions involve influence, engagement or relevancy - because at the end of the day everyone's objective is to sell stuff, the focus should be on how likely an audience is to buy based on a recommendation or feature, not how many people may have seen a picture of it and scrolled on by. (Some of my blogger friends have much smaller audiences than me, but their engagement is insane; their followers lap up everything they say, buy everything they recommend and comment on every single thing they publish. You just can't buy that sh*t.) These questions and constant justifications make us all a little paranoid about our numbers, so it's easy to understand why some may feel the need to give themselves a helping hand.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn a nutshell: brands want numbers, PRs need to deliver on  numbers, PRs search for bloggers with big numbers so they can tick boxes  and report on the great job they've done, bloggers feel a bit inadequate with all the questions and focus on numbers, bloggers buy followers, numbers make PR happy, PR makes brand happy by giving them big numbers. Do you see how it's a vicious circle? Until the circle ends, until everyone makes a concerted effort to educate brands about the importance of engagement and relevancy, this shady behaviours will continue and it's only going to get worse. I've heard so many stories about bloggers creating a whole fake identity and blagging their way into campaigns, launches, trips and experiences off of the back of a falsified Instagram account - because nobody bothered to check. I've seen digital influencers scoop their own makeup collaborations and big brand campaigns from an inflated social presence - because nobody bothered to check. If you're a PR or work with bloggers in some capacity, please take a little time and bother to check (for everyone involved.)\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI've been running my blog for nearly seven years and I've had some amazing experiences and opportunities land in my inbox. It's hard not to compare yourself to people that have got twice the following you have in half the time, but I have to remind myself that I have a niche and I'm proud of that niche; everything I've done has been generated because of hard work, love and passion - not cheating. Although buying a few followers doesn't mean what the blogger produces doesn't have value (often the opposite,) it does seem incredibly unfair on those of us that creep up gradually with pure grit and determination. This kind of activity reflects badly on all of us; it reflects negatively on the industry as a whole, when we're already perceived as giggling girls with swishy hair and nothing much to say for themselves. We have to justify our existence so often that it's becoming exhausting, and this really isn't helping.

Although many believe it to be an unnecessary commotion against the Trump regime which will make no difference, the #WomensMarch was so much more than that; the images that have filled my social media feeds over the last few days have shown that this was more than just a popular protest against a new president, but a way of us all expressing our frustration, anger, sadness and worry of what's to come. In the last few decades we've progressed so much on the road to equality, but we're really not there yet - if anything, we're set to take a step back over the coming few years as Trump revokes legislation that made a real difference to people far beyond US borders. (Partner that with the impending Brexit mess, where established European equality rights are under threat too, and we're in a bit of a mess.) And that's why these marches went global; that's why these events saw people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, sexualities and ages take to the streets with their sassy signs to show everyone that they'd had enough.

(It's a scary word, I get it, but if you're not a feminist then please explain your reasoning?) In case you're wondering, feminism is defined as a range of political movements, ideologies and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish and achieve political, economic, personal and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities in education and employment, access to healthcare and to be at no disadvantage simply because of their gender. Who would not want that? As a feminist (and yes I'm proud to use that label,) I'm willing to do  what I can (no matter how small) to make a change for the future and  impact lives around the world in a positive way.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI've been fortunate enough to have grown up in an environment that encouraged me to do whatever I wanted to do, to break down barriers and to reach for the stars; yet I have still had to fight for equal pay and recognition in the workplace, to justify my place at a meeting table simply because I have boobs and to prove that I can be interested in lipstick and politics simultaneously. Over the last few decades we've progressed so far, but there is still a long road ahead of us - as we can all testament to when we really start to think about what impact inequality has on a daily basis. (And this is even before we start to consider the inequality of WOC, LGBT and disabled women. Then I just want to cry.) \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs women we still make less than a man for doing the same job - whether that’s in tech, as a CEO, as an athlete or as a doctor. As women we still don’t have full rights over our own bodies, as men are continually debating and making choices that impact our uteruses. As women we still have to pay tax on sanitary products because they’re classified as a ‘luxury’. (If men had periods you know that would have been scrapped decades ago.) As a woman we still have to justify our outfit choices and defend ourselves when men think they have the right to touch us. As a woman we still have to fight to breastfeed in public and apologise for those we offend in the process. As women we’re constantly scrutinised for our appearance, whether that’s a celebrity who is a bit soft around the tummy or a Prime Minister who happens to like shoes. As women we’re valued on our looks rather than our brains, but suffer vitriol if we dare take care of our appearance more than is deemed acceptable. It's exhausting. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBE THANKFUL FOR THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE YOU \u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EIf it wasn’t for those that came before us standing up and wanting to be heard, we would not have the lives we do now. We wouldn’t have had the right to an equal education or even the right to work; we wouldn't have had the right to vote or have a say in our own futures; we wouldn’t have access to birth control, the right to choose or able to have a legal abortion carried out in a safe environment. Every day I'm grateful for those that paved the way and made my existence what is is, because without them our situation would be way worse than it is - but it could still be better. For those of you that don't understand why women marched in their millions this past weekend, or wondered what difference it would really make, and for those of you that don't deem yourself disadvantaged because of your gender: we are not equal, whichever way you look at it, and that is why a revolution is coming. I can understand those that want to shy away from hard hitting issues, who prefer to let others do the hard work in their name, but be respectful of the fact you would not be enjoying the opportunities you do if it were not for others. \u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWHAT CAN WE DO?

Within days of Trump taking office he's reversed a bill that provided healthcare and support to women in developing and war torn countries, because the same institutions that provide support may also facilitate an abortion. That's not ok and it's not the solution. Stopping access to healthcare and safe treatment only causes women to be forced into dangerous situations; they're not able to stand up for themselves, so its our responsibility to champion their causes for them.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ERight now my feeds are jampacked with inspirational content and discussion around these issues, and I really hope that doesn't waiver.

Each features a cleanser to use before and ensure there's no trace of makeup or dirt left to prevent the enriched mask from getting to work, as well as a night cream to apply afterwards to boost the benefits and hydrate the skin. Available in three variants (Too Many Late Nights, Turn Back The Clock and Instant Glow) this is a fun take on the trend.

You can use it as a first step when applying your morning skincare, spritz over makeup for a dewy and refreshed look or add a touch throughout the day when you need a boost; the mist isn't the finest and it takes a bit of getting used to before you get the perfect amount, but it's a great little treat to pop in your handbag when the cold zaps all the goodness from our complexions.

You do have to thoroughly exfoliate and delicately tap balm into the surface of lips to get the best result (and maybe if you're concious of fine lines give this a miss,) but they're just beaut.

However, it has gone through rigorous tolerance testing on people with severe atopy, under dermatological and ophthalmological control; it’s fragrance and paraben free, while the pigments used are purified and nickel-controlled to avoid any eye or skin irritation. Rather interestingly the mascara contains an ‘anti-tears formula’, with Reconstituted Lachrymal Liquid, which imitates a tears natural composition ensuring eyes do not react or run. There's still a lot of stuff in here that could be a potential irritant so it's worth having a look at the ingredient list before you buy, but I like the idea of this for those of you that suffer with eye irritation and usually have to steer clear of mascara. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-o5wC0pe8oms\/WIYOaDgMEEI\/AAAAAAAAiYE\/IArE3WGQnect2B28Guvq9yOPDyez4IjTACEw\/s1600\/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B%2B2.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cb\u003E6. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/PIZ-BUIN-Glacier-Cream-SPF-30-High-40ml_1735526\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EPiz Buin Glacier Cream\u003C\/a\u003E (£11.00) \u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EGot any skiing trips coming up, or just simply want to stock up in case there's a snowstorm?

Over the years I've upped my game and taken the time to understand the benefit a targeted regime can bring - both in the immediacy and long-term. As I hit my mid-thirties I'm starting to see those fine lines appear around the eyes, the gentle sagging of my jawline and the change in texture of my overall face; a bad night's sleep can be seen instantly under my eyes, while a week or two of over-indulgence takes double that amount to recover from. However, it isn't all doom and gloom; I'm fully embracing the changes that are appearing as a sign of experience and having lived my life, even if I want to give them a helping hand and minimise them wherever possible. One of the big things I've learned over the years is that skincare products really are #BetterTogether; that is, using a serum alongside an eye cream, moisturiser and overnight treatment will provide far better results than relying on a standalone product. Each provides the skin with targeted care and ingredients that have been included for specific benefit, but together just four steps can help totally change the look and feel of your skin.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-YtL5dQNpjPk\/WICMBMAt4_I\/AAAAAAAAiVY\/hF3fcXfTd7w9nPqlPsBao-fwe6SjaBkOQCEw\/s1600\/Skincare%2BIs%2B%2523BetterTogether%2BWhy%2BYou%2BNeed%2BA%2BComplete%2BRegime%2BFor%2BLuminous%2B%2526%2BYouthful%2BLooking%2BSkin%2B7.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003ESERUM: Often formulated with concentrated and hard working ingredients, this lightweight and easily absorbed product will help target issues (i.e. fine lines) and rectify them over time. As we start to age this becomes even more important and an essential part of any regime. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EEYE CREAM: The skin around our eyes is incredibly thin, so usual moisturisers and products are too heavy, clogging the area and causing puffiness. An eye cream will help reduce the appearance of dark circles and fine lines, without overloading the delicate skin. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EDAY CREAM: Providing a moisture hit that's essential for maintaining radiance, a great day cream will lubricate the skin and help to plump the skin so your complexion looks refreshed. Most also contain SPF, which helps protect the skin from the sun's damaging rays. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ENIGHT TREATMENT: A rich and nourishing treatment that gets to work as you sleep is your secret weapon. Our bodies are far better at 'repairing' while we slumber as they're less focused on keeping our bodies moving, meaning it's the perfect time to lather on a hardworking cream and awake feeling refreshed. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlthough I rarely use a singular brand for the entire offering (preferring to dabble in lots of different treats and bring you an edit of my faves,) one that I would always recommend is No7. Their 'Protect \u0026amp; Perfect' range is iconic in more ways than one; a decade ago it was the first skincare innovation that was independently proven  without doubt to reduce the appearance of fine lines and  wrinkles over time. The press went mad; women went even madder. Boots  sold a years  worth of stock in two weeks, waiting lists filled up and bottles were  being sold online for three times their value. It became a multi-award  winning cult classic that's adorned the bathrooms of millions of women  across the globe - because, put simply, it works. They've expanded the range to include more targeted and even more effective products over the years, and it's one of the affordable ranges I will always recommend to those wishing to invest in an effective skincare regime. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis January No7 has gone one step further and revolutionised its entire \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/No-7\/Skincare\/Age-range-45-60\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELift \u0026amp; Luminate\u003C\/a\u003E range (targeted at 40+ skin and including Day, Night and Eye Cream) to help women’s skin look at its absolute best; hot on the heels of the No7’s Lift \u0026amp; Luminate Triple Action Serum (the UK’s No1 serum brand*,) they’ve added the same powerful technology to the skincare range as is in the serum. This new and improved blend of ingredients helps women achieve even better anti-ageing results that really deliver, especially when using all four of the products together. The unique 'triple action' technology makes Lift \u0026amp; Luminate No7’s  most hardworking skincare regime yet; having been proven to help tackle  the most common signs of ageing to deliver maximum results - wrinkles  are visibly reduced, skin appears lifted and is noticeably firmer, while  skin tone is more even.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ERather interestingly, when clinically tested 88% of women saw even better results when they used the new day cream with the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/No-7\/Skincare\/Age-range-45-60\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELift \u0026amp; Luminate\u003C\/a\u003E serum - proving without a doubt that doubling up will give you even better results in as little as two weeks. So what are these magic ingredients that help skin look and feel so much better, I hear you ask? Well all of the products are enriched with Matrixyl 3000, No7’s most effective anti-wrinkle technology that's a powerful peptide blend which helps restore more youthful looking skin; additionally Hyaluronic Acid helps provide additional skin-firming benefits through its powerful water retaining abilities, hibiscus extract helps support collagen production, making skin look and feel smoother and firmer, while a 'Lightening Complex' (containing Indian gooseberry and Vitamin C) works to help rebalance melanin content in the skin, providing a more even skin tone and a fading of visible pigmentation.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs Lift \u0026amp; Luminate isn't quite suitable for my skin type just yet, I'm giving a stash to some of my loved ones so they can put it to the test on my behalf in the next few weeks and report back - because we're all #BetterTogether right? What's even better is that nine other bloggers from my Thirty Plus collective are also putting the product to the test, so you can pop on over to their sites to see how they're getting on too. (Links are below!) Even better than that? I want FIVE of you guys to get involved too, putting the entire regime through its paces in the coming weeks so I can share your stories and thoughts here on London Beauty Queen; I've got FIVE full sets of all four products up for grabs (worth £93.90) so if you want to be a part of the experience, just enter via the widget below. No7 believe that not only skincare is #BetterTogether, but we are too - so it's great to see an opportunity for so many women to come together and take the first step on a joruney together.

You've probably seen it all over your Insta-feed and your favourite bloggers have probably been professing to it being the most life-changing thing they've ever read - but with good reason. I devoured this little treat of a book over a few dreary January evenings, when I really needed a kick up the posteria and a way to start my new year off with a new outlook; devoured is probably the best adjective to describe how most people will consume the words that are on the page, as it's hard to put down once you get going. Our digital world has led us to be ever more concerned with the way we're perceived and how we document our lives online; whereas before our dodgy hairstyles and badly curated outfits were lost for all time, now you only have to scroll back through a Facebook feed to see the horrors in all their glory. With the opening of our lives and their every detail, comes the inevitable scrutiny and comparison - and that in turn can leave us feeling dejected, somewhat of a failure (be it career wise, handbag wise or simply achieving those life milestones that you're 'supposed' to tick off by a certain age) and giving too many f*cks about what everyone else thinks. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-RpFc0J-Pnok\/WH-AiV5OQdI\/AAAAAAAAiT4\/BvRNpTXu6Y0B9Ot_k25XfybRwWNxIZPJACLcB\/s1600\/Outsmart%2BThe%2BCity%2BThe%2BIncreasing%2BImportance%2BOf%2BDaily%2BSPF%2B%2526%2BPollution%2BProtection%2B%2528PLUS%2BWIN%2529%2B%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EPair that with FOMO (fear of missing out,) because every event and after-work drink is documented across every social media outlet going, and we're left feeling like a bit of douche. Not only do we collectively waste too much time on comparison and attempting to please others, but as a result have far less time to spend giving a f*ck about what's actually important to us. That's where \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/product\/1784298468\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;camp=1634\u0026amp;creative=6738\u0026amp;creativeASIN=1784298468\u0026amp;linkCode=as2\u0026amp;tag=lonbeaque-21\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESarah Knight\u003C\/a\u003E and all her ingeniousness comes in. 'The Life-Changing Magic' and her 'Not Sorry' method provide a simple, yet incredibly effective, way to look at your life and reflect upon what's important to you personally. She sets out her reasoning behind the method by comparing it to those tidying books that have been so incredibly popular, suggesting that the easiest way to ensure maximum life satisfaction is to clear away the clutter and find those gems that really do make you happy. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESplit into four sections (things, work, friends and family,) the book encourages you to digest each area in turn and work out what actually you don't (or shouldn't) give a toss about and what you want to care more about moving forward. Whether it's annoying family gatherings that leave you feeling sh*tty, charity collections that guilt you into parting with your hard-earned cash, or friends that drain your time with baby showers and hen do's that you'd really rather skip, this book not only facilitates change but provides you with ways of backing out that don't leave you looking like the bad guy.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn the interests of transparency, I went into this experience thinking I didn't give much of a f*ck anyway; maybe it's age, maybe it's just the fact that I'm confident in my own skin and outlook, but on the whole I haven't cared about what people think for some time. Although my 20's were filled with paranoia and an inability to love myself for who I was, my 30's have proven the complete opposite: I know who I am, what I have to offer and revel in my own uniqueness. I'm not afraid to have an opinion, share an opinion or to decline an offer of something I don't want to do, but that doesn't mean that this little pink book couldn't reaffirm my viewpoints and leave me feeling invigorated. There were still lots of things that I realised I was spending too much energy on, rather than focusing on more important elements that will actually make me happier in the long term. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAs I turned the pages I found myself nodding profusely; the book isn't rocket science (in fact it's just common sense,) but it takes someone to write it down and tell you when you're good and ready for it to make a difference. Living online it's easy to get caught in a little bubble where numbers, designer handbags and perfectly applied eyeshadow are the most important things in the world - this book allows you the headspace to realise they're really not, and to identify other things your energy would be far better directed to. In case you need a little inspo, here are some of my key areas of 'less f*cks given' versus where I want to re-direct my energy. Writing them down is incredibly cathartic in itself. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EGiving Less F*cks\u003Cbr \/\u003E1. What people online think about the way I look. (Yes I know I have a fat arse.)\u003Cbr \/\u003E2. Spending my time in pointless meetings and wasting away afternoons 'networking'.\u003Cbr \/\u003E3. Worrying that I eat too much chocolate and drinking too much wine.\u003Cbr \/\u003E4. Number and stat checking constantly, for fear that I'm not 'big' enough.\u003Cbr \/\u003E5. Comparing myself to others: \"I haven't got married\/bought a house\/had a kid yet, sob.\" \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EGiving More F*cks\u003Cbr \/\u003E1. Championing women over thirty and showing diversity online.\u003Cbr \/\u003E2. Using my time efficiently and meeting up with friends I haven't seen in an age.\u003Cbr \/\u003E3. Being healthier in general and spending quality time getting fit. (Hello new gym membership.)\u003Cbr \/\u003E4. Generating an engaged audience that really appreciate the stuff I write about.\u003Cbr \/\u003E5. Focusing on being happy and grateful for what I do have\/what I've actually achieved.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESo why do we all need a 'F*ck Budget'? Because, quite frankly, we're all wasting our time giving too many f*cks about stuff that really isn't that important - when we could be focusing on other stuff that makes us happy. It doesn't make a difference if you want to swap up christenings or karaoke for saving the planet or catching up on Netflix, but it's about using your precious time and energy in the ways that you want to. If you need some perspective and to stop worrying about everyone that disagrees with you online, or just a boost of confidence for when you're sharing that next selfie, you need this book.

Collectively we want more than just endless reams of beauty reviews: we want opinion, insight and to be educated. I've made the decision to focus less on product features and more on trends, predictions, edits and new ways of presenting what I'm using - so the information is more useful to those of you looking for recommendations. For a long time I feel like beauty bloggers have been in the hands of brands, bowing to pressure to feature one thing over another because of obligation rather than passion, and I for one am stepping out of that game. I'll continue to bring you news and information on what's new via my 'New This Week' features (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2017\/01\/new-in-this-week-ten-beautifying-treats.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ethe first one of which you can find here\u003C\/a\u003E,) but unless I'm absolutely convinced you need to know about something on a stand-alone basis then it'll make room for something a little more interesting. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMUCH MORE OF ME\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EYep, get used to my mug because you'll be seeing a lot more of it on here. In a shiny world full of perfect twenty-somethings with better eyebrows than I'll ever have, it's hard to build up the courage to share pictures of my slightly greying hair, expanding waistline and increasingly wrinkly under-eye area. But it's also incredibly frustrating to see a whitewash of little more than cookie-cutter moulds all over my feeds. I feel somewhat of a responsibility to my fellow thirty-somethings to put myself out there a little more, personalise my site and enable you all to feel like you know the face behind the blog. I've found a great woman squad that has helped me gain the confidence to just crack on with it, as well as connecting with people that can actually take my picture - hoorah! To be honest, that's most of the battle, so I'm making a concerted effort to let people snap my face and revel in posting it on the internet. \u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003EHere's to a great year ahead.

Although I love the beauty industry with all my heart and adore putting things to the test, I want London Beauty Queen to be about more than that. I want to be able to continue to bring you advice, discussion, news and edits of some of the things I'm using without always being bogged down by the stuff that's landing on my desk - often it's all shiny, new and distracting, giving you a taster of fab things that you can buy to meet an immediate need rather than investments that you'll continue to use and enjoy for months to come. As a result, every week (or fortnightly if there's not much going on!) I'll be bringing you an edit of what's new, noteworthy and lustworthy in a more manageable format with bitesized reviews and first impressions. If anything keeps my attention span for a little longer or is genuinely changing my life, I'll happily feature it again to let you know.

These 'Lid Lingerie' eye creams are incredibly pigmented and super creamy to apply, buffing or blending easily to create everything from the most subtle of looks to a full on smokey eye. (There's a great silver shade, as well as a red and green if you're feeling more daring.) Thankfully the formula dries really quickly to leave a perfect result without any smudging, creasing or sticking; I'm loving the more nude shades on the spectrum for adding a bit more texture into a natural look. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2jfnvXu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EMerci Handi Cleansing Gel\u003C\/a\u003E (£3.00)\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHand hygiene gel has never been sexy, but it is functional and used by millions of commuters all over the globe.

Basically it's a L'Oreal term for cleansing conditioner, when they basically realise they're about two years late to the party. The same issues are still apparent that caused our obsession with cleansing conditioners to go into overdrive: overworked, over nourished and over stripped strands. A cleansing conditioner (or low shampoo) can help alleviate dullness, dryness, limp hair and general lethargy with your style; you apply this formula to your entire head and leave to get to work for around three minutes, washing it out to reveal a refreshed look beneath. If you've got super dry, thin, overly styled or coloured hair, then this could be just for you - but be careful to give it a proper wash at least once a week or the build-up may cause whole new issues of their own. Both of these formulas contain nourishing and caring ingredients to help infuse hair with goodness and are well worth a go for the price point, I just don't know if I'm ready to revert back to leaving the shampoo on the shelf! \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-XaG9DPe_mIE\/WHixE0FcL4I\/AAAAAAAAiR4\/pibdLVgdXXQUSX7InxvqRhpPIDNDtsxzwCEw\/s1600\/loreal%2Blow%2Bshampoo%2Bbenefit%2Btheyre%2Breal%2Blipstick%2Bnyx%2Blid%2Blingerie%2Blottie%2Blondon%2Bessie%2Btreat%2Blove%2Bcare%2B9.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E8. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2jEVlSh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBenefit They're Real Double The Lip Lipstick\u003C\/a\u003E (£16.50)\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EOne of the big trends \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2017\/01\/the-big-news-in-beauty-eight-exciting.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EI identified for 2017\u003C\/a\u003E was the two-tone lip; big news in Korea, the ombre effect is set to make its way over here too - and Benefit are the first brand to jump on that trend. With six shades in total (some more statement than others) each includes two complementary tones that should act as a lip liner and colour in one; the result should be a subtle graduated look, but you have to concentrate when you're applying in order to achieve that. Although many of the shades are almost too subtle to really notice, a couple are more statement and need a brave day to rock them! Colour aside, I actually really like the lipstick formula and bullet; it's creamy and rich without overloading the lips, providing a great colour result with a precise finish. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E9. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2jfwb0d\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBenefit They're Real Duo Eyeshadow Blender\u003C\/a\u003E (£19.50)\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBenefit have been busy!

Although they're not incredible quality, there are a few gems (including the creamy eyeshadows and bold liquid lipsticks) worth picking up when you pop into Superdrug for some cotton wool.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHave any of these newbies got you clicking 'add to basket' already? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-ZoP-1E3fa0o\/WHiwOlZ0eJI\/AAAAAAAAiRc\/No00b2AwPGQpQ-X0WOMWFd8q2RYyT-g_gCEw\/s1600\/loreal%2Blow%2Bshampoo%2Bbenefit%2Btheyre%2Breal%2Blipstick%2Bnyx%2Blid%2Blingerie%2Blottie%2Blondon%2Bessie%2Btreat%2Blove%2Bcare%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-XIQ7QuJqyz0\/WHiwPPmyipI\/AAAAAAAAiRg\/uE2Ot-wEXMMi1hzyPQDod4VYXuPMbWJCwCEw\/s1600\/loreal%2Blow%2Bshampoo%2Bbenefit%2Btheyre%2Breal%2Blipstick%2Bnyx%2Blid%2Blingerie%2Blottie%2Blondon%2Bessie%2Btreat%2Blove%2Bcare%2B10.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca class=\"bloglovin-widget\" data-blog-id=\"2158708\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/2158708\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/madmimi.com\/signups\/147076\/join\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003E \u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Well, well, well, dear bloggersphere: you've certainly been busy over the last twelve months haven't you? The beauty of our digital space is that it's ever evolving and organically changing into something even better, always keeping us on our toes and proving you can never be too complacent. 2016 definitely saw the rise of the 'influencer' rather than vlogger\/blogger, with this new generation of mega-stars not even needing a website from which to do their influencing - just an Instagram channel and a lot of great poses. We saw a plethora of new sites launch and with them the onset of new talent taking the world by storm, as well as new channels come and go (hello Insta-Stories, see you later Vine!) alongside the understanding that you can actually blog over the age of 30 (because we're not all computer-illiterate you know.) So much happened and so much changed, many of which I predicted, but rather more interestingly: what do we think is to come for our beloved bloggersphere in the next 12 months?

Although it's incredibly popular with some, for most it became a clunky channel that was incredibly hard to grow without constant promotion (why on earth didn't they introduce a search function?) I loved the rawness and realness, but as soon as Insta-Stories launched I put down my Snapchat filter for the very last time - like many others around me. With zero effort required and an existing audience ready and waiting, it's no surprise I was receiving four times the amount of views on Instagram (even without the fancy face-swap filters.) As Instagram continue to evolve the instantaneous element of their 'stories' function, I'm sure it will be the nail in the coffin of their snappy competitor; we simply don't have the time (or storage) for more apps and Snapchat is just another thing to cause us stress. Give it a year and it'll be as dead as the Bakerloo line on tube strike day - while Instagram, on the other hand, is bound to fly. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMICRO-BLOGGING\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EFeeding into the trend of influencers spending less time focusing on their blogs and more time just uploading cracking Instagram content, the rise of micro-blogging will undoubtedly play a big role. I'm seeing more and more of my feed curating great grids and telling stories in their captions, rather than mindlessly chucking up any old tosh just to keep their feed fresh. With the launch of Insta-Stories we all have the capacity to vlog without any editing skills required, while the image uploads themselves provide an opportunity to tell a story. The days of #BeachGoals or \"Love This!\" and re-gramming quotes are long gone, in favour of more meaningful content that's a platform for influence in its own right. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBUDGETS ARE 'BOUT TO GET BIG\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EOver the last few years we've definitely seen brands look to work with infleuncers more and more, actively adding in lines of budget in their overall year-long plan. However, with the decline in print media (by the end of this year I guarantee you you'll be able to count the number of magazines left on your hands) they're looking to re-allocate those budgets online. If you think about the millions of pounds previously spent on magazine and television adverts, there needs to be somewhere else to spend that marketing budget. Happy days. However, with more and more focus on relevancy and ROI (return on their investment) rather than just eyeballs or mega stats, campaigns are set to become more strategic and long-term rather than brands just chucking money at superstars and hoping it sticks. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWILL VIDEO BE KING?\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EThere's a lot of talk right now about YouTube being the key place that brands want to be, because apparently 2017 is the year that video becomes well and truly king. It's undeniable that younger audiences flock to video and get their daily fix of information online versus the tellybox or newspaper, but more and more we're seeing older stars using video to get their point across too. I'm seeing increasing numbers of bloggers in their 30's, 40's and beyond adopting this form of media and I don't see the trend slowing down any time soon. Although I personally don't have the patience, skill or inclination to commit properly to a channel, for many this could be the year that the focus drops from fairy-lit bedrooms and Primark hauls to something altogether more interesting. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPHOTOS THAT TELL A STORY\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E2017 marks seven whole years since I started blogging. Back in 2010 bloggers barely even owned a camera, focusing on their words alone to tell a story - with maybe a few swatches snapped on a smartphone alongside a stock image or two so you knew what they were chatting about. Skip forward a few years and the focus is undoubtedly on bloggers' ability to tell a story through the images they use and the emotion they present. It's no longer sufficient to just take a picture of that new lipstick on your coffee table; you have to style that shoot to rival Vogue, and have all the props to go alongside it. Increasingly I'm hearing brands want to collaborate with bloggers that create beautiful imagery (that they can use on their own channels,) and readers want to connect with sites that provide something aspirational to look at.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EDIVERSE CAMPAIGNS \u0026amp; DIVERSE AUDIENCES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EOne of the most refreshing changes I started to see in 2016 was the focus on placing the right campaigns with the right blogger, with the aim of reaching the right audience; it seemed that for many brands it was no longer about reaching as many people as possible, but about reaching the right people in the right way so they had a higher propensity to purchase. Through my \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/wearethirtyplus.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EThirty Plus\u003C\/a\u003E network (a collective of over 700 bloggers,) I've seen a spike in interest for those that hit the right audience and share an ethos with the brand in question; the willingness to take a hit on numbers in favour of relevancy is incredibly refreshing, and sets the scene for a turn of events in 2017. One of my biggest predictions is that more campaigns will be lead by bloggers and social media platforms, and more of them will represent the diversity that exists on every single street. I hope and expect to see all shapes, sizes, colours, ages and choices represented - and for bloggers to prove it's ok to be exactly who you are.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EDo you have any other big predictions for the year ahead?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-82pwX2Ll2OQ\/WHTtVeIQiEI\/AAAAAAAAiPY\/t0x5Qimc5vsoPsAH_KzG3qvL1KNzRi4rQCLcB\/s1600\/Do%2BYou%2BNeed%2BTo%2BSpend%2BA%2BFortune%2BOn%2BMakeup%2BBrushes%2BHow%2BTo%2BShop%2BEffectively%2BFor%2BYour%2BTools%2B5.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca class=\"bloglovin-widget\" data-blog-id=\"2158708\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/2158708\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/madmimi.com\/signups\/147076\/join\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003E \u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Clinique's Chubby Sticks have always provided a little way to leave you feeling happy, with every application providing a wash of colour wrapped up in a not-too-serious pack, but this January they're taking that one step further by teaming up with a brand that's been part of childhoods across the globe for decades: Crayola.

Although that's all very lovely, it's the iconic packaging that makes these little lip treats so covetable - including a very special 'crayon box' within which to store the entire collection.

They vary from the very sheer to the more noticeable finishes of Red Violet and Brick Red, but all glide over lips effortlessly and leave a very comfortable finish. You don't need me to preach the power of a lip crayon (they've been copied so many times before that we all know the format - even though Chubby Sticks will always be the original and the best!) but suffice to say I expect everyone to get a little bit excited about such a unique and fun collaboration.

I was outspoken, independent, chubby and not especially talented at anything related to sports or music; although I had a lot of friends and moved easily between circles, I never made that life-long connection with someone that I could rely on indefinitely. Over the years I've had many people I would consider 'best friends', providing the support I needed at different stages in my life, but few remain. People phase in and out of your inner circle all the time, serving different purposes and being with you as you experience different moments - and that's ok. Those we're forced into friendship circles with don't have to stick around forever, as we instead stumble across people that can really make a difference to your outlook on life and ability to be the best kind of person you can be.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-IO3hTD7Ar7k\/WHS3ra1Z8GI\/AAAAAAAAiPA\/GxBcWLI2x5sOzI4mObTE8-powZiVyh9ZQCLcB\/s1600\/The%2BImportance%2BOf%2BHaving%2BA%2BGreat%2BWoman%2BSquad%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EDoing what I do it can be quite lonely and isolating, so having connections becomes even more important; not having a colleague to turn around to and discuss last night's telly or quietly moan about that b*tch of a client, really does make a difference. There's nobody to tell you how well you're doing, point out areas for improvement or provide a touch of encouragement when you need it most; there's nobody to talk to (often from one day to the next) and a lot of the time not even the motivation, inclination or reason to leave your house for anything other than some more milk for your coffee. Our natural human instincts see us crave the attention and support of a likeminded community, so it's increasingly difficult to completely go it alone; I've worked hard and I'm incredibly privileged, but it's certainly not easy.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIf there's one thing that 2016 proved to me is that the importance of surrounding yourself with good people can never be underestimated. I've managed to find my own little #WomanSquad that have collectively kept me going, supported me through the ups and downs, made me laugh, let me get things off my chest, provided advice, helped to bounce ideas around and generally been at the end of a phone or WhatsApp message to keep me on the straight and narrow. Blogging and digital media is such a new phenomenon that for those working outside the field it's as foreign as another language: I often try to talk to my partner and girlfriends about the stresses or dramas that fill my days, but more often than not it takes longer to provide context than it does discuss the issue. Unsurprisingly I give up, using the generic line of \"yeah everything's great, really busy, but yeah fab!\" to move the conversation onto something else.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESo what of this #WomanSquad? To my detriment I'm naturally a very highly strung, stressed and impulsive person; having a group of incredibly intelligent, passionate, successful and motivated women around me has helped not only to sedate that impulse and calm my frustration, but it's taught me that talking through an issue with someone a little removed from the situation can help you come up with a far more successful solution. Not only that, but when we all need a moan and a good whinge about this or that, having an empathetic set of hands typing at the other end is often all we need to feel 100% better. It doesn't matter if you're a blogger, self employed, working a 9-5 or even a full time mum, having strong and supportive people around you is the secret to simply getting sh*t done. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI met LEX (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/talontedlex.co.uk\/\"\u003Etalontedlex.co.uk\u003C\/a\u003E) during a round-table discussion on rosacea a few years ago, but it's only been in the last year we've really become good friends. Regular blogging dates in London keep us both fresh and full of ideas, while she's the voice of reason whenever I'm having a panic. Incredibly respected in her field, I love seeing her grow from strength to strength. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EKIRSTY (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/fashionforlunch.net\/\"\u003Efashionforlunch.net\u003C\/a\u003E) and I met when she gate-crashed my table outside Starbucks; and there a friendship was born. A complete nutter (and a colourful one at that,) Kirsty's kind heart and ever-lasting humour always brightens my day. Possibly even more cynical than me, I love debating the ins and outs of the blogging world and putting the world to rights.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMy birthday twin LEAH (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.devotedtopink.com\/\"\u003Edevotedtopink.com\u003C\/a\u003E) and I share the same passion and enthusiasm for making our own way. It's always refreshing to meet people with the same outlook as you, especially when you're the exact same age and proving you don't have to change who you are just because you turn 30. A kick-ass business woman with big things to come. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAnd finally, JANE (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/britishbeautyblogger.com\/\"\u003Ebritishbeautyblogger.com\u003C\/a\u003E) can only be described as my rock. Over the years Jane has soothed my worries and concerns, let me vent my frustrations and helped me to think in macro rather than micro detail. With a wealth of knowledge up her sleeves, she's not afraid to be brutally honest - something that I utterly respect. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003EThese four women together keep my passion channeled, keep me from making silly decisions and keep me laughing. Although there are so many more incredible women that I don't have the space to mention, it's these four that together that have helped me more than they'll ever know. There's no competitiveness or cattiness, just support and openness to help one another meet our goals. Different perspectives, passions and strengths can help everyone in the long-term - and my #WomanSquad has helped me park the tears, outbursts and stresses in favour of laughter and the realisation that the world won't come to an end over lipstick.

La-Eva stems from a spirit of joie de vivre,\u2028 builds on artisan roots, aligns naturally with the organic movement and thoughtfully creates high end products.\"\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELa-Eva offers a four piece collection that contains a hand wash and body lotion in two dellectable fragrances: Roseum contains notes of geranium, petigrain and clove for a sensual, relaxing, uplifting experience; Blu includes chamomile, cedarwood and vetiver for a soothing, calming and grounding sensation. Packaged in perfectly on-trend and classic chic amber glass apothecary-style bottles (in a variety of sizes that range from a handbag sized 85ml to a mega 500ml bathroom version,) the result is something that's as much of a pleasure to use as it is to look at. The formulas are organic (not because it's on-trend, but because in Louisa's words 'why would they not be?') and beautiful to use, leaving behind a thoroughly addictive scent that's akin to an artisan perfume.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhat's so unique and different about La-Eva is that it's been created by true artists in an environment that's incredibly inspiring; I visited the workshop where the brand was born and it's no surprise the result is something I'm hotly tipping to be in the bathrooms of the most exclusive establishments in the next few years. Even the label has been designed with the help of an artist that resides next door, La-Eva being the culmination of a real community and every bottle hand poured with love. I'm not one to get overly excited by hand wash or lotion (the lotion can be used everywhere FYI, not just on your hands!) but this has really captured a spirit which I'm completely on-board with. La-Eva is a brand that proves small-fry, artisan, community made and organic doesn't have to mean compromising on quality or experience. It's incredibly affordable (prices start from only £8.50) but absolutely looks the part; watch this space, for it's about to become a name to be reckoned with. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhat do you think of this new brand?

Whether that was a beautiful new eyeshadow palette, a hard working night treatment or a shampoo that left my hair full of bounce, there were a lot of great discoveries and purchases in 2016 that together made up over 300 individual posts. I've been looking back through all of them to see what products have stood the test of time, which ones I'm still using, how many I've re-purchased and what I would genuinely recommend a year on - the result of which is an edit of twelve seriously fabulous finds I couldn't be without.

Klorane has been around for decades, but I'd never heard of it until last year when they were celebrating their 50th birthday; their dry shampoo has apparently been an industry and beauty editor favourite for years, but finally I'm in on the act too.

Even though it's a trend I'm sure will waive in the coming months, the idea behind it is a genius one and has been adopted by some great brands with some fabulous products - including L'Oreal. Out of all the 'multi masking' products available, these were by far my faves. Affordable, effective, a pleasure to use and beautifully presented, they provide a way of buying into the trend or just treating yourself to a new mask.

Elizabeth Arden this year launched a groundbreaking product that I'm already on my second tube of; the Prevage City Smart SPF50 helps to not only protect against free radical and UV damage, but also helps to actually repair damage that's already been done. The lightweight tinted lotion glides over skin to leave an invisible finish, proving that daily suncare doesn't have to be heavy or tropical. Another expensive one at £55.00 a bottle, but it lasts an age and will really help prevent a certain level of damage control in the future.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2016\/08\/outsmart-city-increasing-importance-of.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERead my original feature here.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBONDI SANDS GRADUAL TANNING FOAM\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EDuring my younger years I was so obsessed with tanning that I practically looked like a different nationality; my boyfriend sees pictures of me from my 20's and the first thing he says is 'you're brown!' After a decade of being a tan worshipper during the summer, I hit my thirties and decided that I couldn't really be bothered with the maintenance - preferring instead to embrace my inner pastiness. However, this bottle of gradual tanner changed all that for the better. The lightweight foam is a doddle to apply and glides over skin to leave behind no streaking or patchiness, only a super natural colour result that develops in a couple of hours. There's no jiggling about until your limbs are dry enoguh to get dressed, just a long-lasting sunkissed colour that's the easiest thing to maintain.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2016\/07\/the-fake-tan-that-can-do-no-wrong-you.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ERead my original feature here.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlthough there are loads of other products I still rate, these are definitely the ones I'm still using pretty much daily and will continue to use throughout 2017.

The opportunity to reflect back on what's passed, as well as looking forward and attempting to predict what's to come. The world of beauty is so fluid and fast paced that it can completely change within a few months; unlike fashion that's somewhat restricted by catwalk shows and seasons, the beauty industry can develop a new idea practically overnight and have it on the high street within a matter of weeks. Rather excitingly it's the smaller brands that have the flexibility to create and innovate according to demand, so the tide is somewhat changing in favour of affordable and niche names - and away from big brands who (in a lot of cases) really need to up their game. Partner that with the increase in digital destinations that are making it their mission to bring new and hotly awaited brands to UK shores, and it's a very exciting time for beauty enthusiasts. But what of the big trends, changes and new launches of 2017? What can we expect to see over the next twelve months and what innovations will become a firm fixture on our bathroom shelves? I've done the research so you don't have to, and these may just be the big trends in beauty that you won't be able to get enough of...\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-3Y6uGKHI0BI\/WG5FkXSlr9I\/AAAAAAAAiMI\/tznyszodwA0c9aVfE9c9jFcEqXEZ0KRJACLcB\/s1600\/The%2BBig%2BNews%2BIn%2BBeauty%2BEight%2BExciting%2BTrends%2BTo%2BLook%2BOut%2BFor%2B%2526%2BFall%2BIn%2BLove%2BWith%2BThis%2BYear%2B%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECLEANSING STICKS\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlready big in Asia, solid cleansing sticks are just starting to make waves on UK shores.

It  makes sense: a solid stick is portable, easy to use, space savvy and  more hygienic than sticking your fingers in a pot at the end of every  day. Cleansing has never been hotter (I like to think us bloggers are to  thank for that,) so this will undoubtedly be a big focus throughout  2017 as brands strive to get us to part with more cash.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENO-MAKEUP MAKEUP\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn what seems to be a backlash against the overly made-up Instagram stars and excessive contouring of the past couple of years, a more natural look is set to take centre stage. Think effortlessly dewy skin, beautifully natural cheekbones, minimal eyeshadow and mascara, a dusting of highlighter and just a touch of nude gloss. Even better, going totally makeup-free is set to be the coolest look of the season. Seen all over the catwalk (including at Isabel Marant,) this will save you time and money in the effort of being on-trend. \u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMICROBLADING \u0026amp; NATURAL BROWS\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI'm a big old fan of the microblading, having had it myself a couple of times over the years (I'm in need of a top-up while I think about it!) but in 2017 it's set to be bigger than ever. Perfectly in keeping with the 'no-makeup makeup' ideal, this semi-permanent procedure crafts the brows you've always wanted using a special blading technique - and they last for up to a year. The result is absolutely natural and perfectly crafted brows that don't look overdone; in case you're wondering, those super chiseled and incredibly angular eyebrows will also be making a firm exit.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EFILTER CREAMS\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI know we probably don't need another step  in our already expansive regime, but filter creams have got me rather  excited. These moisturisers are enriched with pearl extracts to luminise  the skin while blurring imperfections, leaving skin looking refreshed;  they're a combination of a great primer and luminous moisturiser,  actually removing a step and aiding the practical expression of the 'no  makeup makeup' look that's also set to be huge. If you love the idea but  loathe the thought of getting your naked face out, this could be a way  to make it all the more flattering. Erborian have already got this down  with their \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2j583JU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EPink Perfect Creme\u003C\/a\u003E, but what else will we be loving in 2017?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECUT CREASE EYESHADOW\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EA trend that may seem old-hat to many of us that live our lives via an Instagram feed, cut crease eyeshadow has actually yet to make it into the mainstream. A counter-trend to the super understated looks that are also set to be big, this eyeshadow technique helps to create a strong angular look and a super professional finish. (For tonnes of examples, \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/uk.pinterest.com\/explore\/cut-crease-eyeshadow\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Esee here\u003C\/a\u003E.) Its foundations come from the iconic 1960's looks of Bridget Bardot and Twiggy, but with a modern twist this statement eyeshadow technique will definitely bring you bang up to date and ready for 2017. (Feeling inspired? There's a great tutorial \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/makeuptutorials.com\/cut-crease\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ehere\u003C\/a\u003E which will help you give it a go.)\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECHROME NAILS\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWe've already seen brands including Barry M and \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.modelsownit.com\/product\/8244\/holochrome-nail-polish#38874\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EModels Own\u003C\/a\u003E dabble in this trend at the end of 2016, but over the next couple of months we'll all apparently be sporting futuristic talons. There are crazy looks all over Pinterest (and starting to trickle into my insta-feed too,) and they don't just rely on having a nail tehcnician on speed dial. With more and more chrome polishes and false nails set to launch this spring, this super luxe look has never been more accessible. Over the last few years the nail category has been incredibly dull (if I see another nude or berry shade I'm going to scream,) so it's refreshing to see something a little more stand-out and different. I've missed statement nails. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003ESILVER OMBRE\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIf you thought 2017 would see the back of ombre, then you'd be wrong. Although blonde ends may be starting to look a bit tired, there are some beautiful alternatives popping up that provide a fresh approach to the look so many of us adore. This year silver and ash blonde ombre is set to be big news, those dusty blonde and brunette locks being replaced by something a little more modern (that will certainly match your chrome nails!) I'm not surprised that our love of silver and super blonde hair is filtering into different categories; watch this space, because you'll be seeing a lot of this across the bloggersphere this year! \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETWO-TONE LIPSTICKS\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EKorean women have been rocking an ombre two-tone lip for a couple of years already, but with Benefit set to launch their \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.benefitcosmetics.com\/uk\/en-gb\/product\/big-sexy-lipstick-set\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eown version\u003C\/a\u003E this February, it's set to become as normalised as a matte lip cream.

Although the start of January can provide the perfect opportunity to give ourselves a jump start and get back into good habits after a few weeks of over-indulgence, it's never going to be the miracle answer to all your life dilemmas. I've never really been one for New Years Resolutions, mainly because January is the worst month of the year to start anything remotely taxing; it's cold, it's dark, we're all broke and there's more chocolate in the house than on the set of Willy Wonka. That doesn't exactly provide the perfect environment for starting on an expensive health kick or putting your willpower to the test. Instead of setting yourself up to fail by over promising on what you can realistically achieve, try smaller and more manageable goals that will make a difference to your life over time - and are far more likely to remain part of your routine than eating 500 calories a day or running five miles a week.

Whether you choose to practice some yoga, get on your bike, lift some weights or dance like Davina, do it first thing so you don't give yourself a chance to back out.

With Brexit and President-Elect Trump making waves across the globe, the repercussions of choices we've made will be felt for years to come; the world is somewhat of a scary place, with terror attacks becoming all the more frequent, while every day Twitter is awash with the breaking news of a new tragedy that will undoubtedly bring us to tears. It's easy to understand why practically everyone was counting down the days until it could all be over, to draw a metaphorical line in the sand and move on to bigger and better things, but is 2016 really deserving of the reputation history will inevitably give it? There are 365 days to reflect back on and I can guarantee that those that have positive memories far outweigh those crappy days we'd rather forget; giving the previous year such a hard time doesn't do anyone any favours - it just puts 2017 on a pedestal and sets us all up to fail before we've even begun.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-69fteQeCiBw\/WGt7cT4LPaI\/AAAAAAAAiKE\/Q8mKS2ua7bc1SwKRKhHngWh5MQ_kXob1QCEw\/s1600\/Why%252BI%252BGive%252BMy%252BFace%252BThe%252BDay%252BOff%252BThe%252BImportance%252BOf%252BMakeup-Free%252BMoments%252B.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EA whole industry has evolved off the back of the 'New Year, New You' concept, but this dangerous approach to life is what only makes us feel like a failure in the months to come. As far as the universe is concerned, what's the difference between one day and the next? How can we be transported from a 'horrific year' on 31st December to one filled with promise a matter of moments later on 1st January? I wholeheartedly embrace the possibility a fresh start presents (especially after a few weeks of overindulgence and laziness,) but we can make our own fresh starts at any point during the year; you don't need a fireworks display and a champagne reception to enable it. I'm seriously excited for what the next twelve months have in store and I've no doubt it will be a year I remember for the rest of my life, but I'm also not ready to park 2016 as one of the worst years in history never to be spoken of again.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ELooking back at the last twelve months, amazing things happened for many of my loved ones. There were engagements, weddings, pregnancy announcements, babies, houses being bought, new jobs, incredible holidays, new experiences and #girlbosses doing it for themselves. Personally speaking it was the most successful year for me yet, working on some incredible campaigns, traveling the globe, interviewing a superstar, growing my Thirty Plus network and making connections with bloggers I'm lucky enough to now consider friends. Retrospectively speaking, 2016 was actually a pretty amazing year and I'd rather we all stopped giving it such a hard time; the more we try to bury it and forget everything it held, the more we have an inflated level of expectation for the year ahead and will find ourselves in a vicious circle of negativity where nothing will ever meet our demands.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ERight now my feeds are full of resolutions, promises and commitments; everyone has a new diary or a notebook where they're writing down their wishes and ideas (myself included,) but it's important to remember the only person that can make a change is you. The dawn of a new year brings with it positivity and possibility, but that can easily be replaced with lethargy when our dreams don't come true instantaneously. In my opinion it's important to take all of the messages we're going to be fed over the next couple of weeks with a massive pinch of salt - because after all, 92% of resolutions fail (and most of them within the first month.) What the start of 2017 can bring, however, is an opportunity to kick-start those positive thoughts and make commitments that can be kept throughout the next twelve months. Making yourself a year long plan and realistic smaller goals is far more productive than believing you're going to change the world, buy a house or lose two stone in the next six weeks.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIt's also vitally important to remember the good moments that 2016 brought you.

I've known Caroline since the very early days of this blog nearly seven years ago, and she's always been on hand with helpful advice and simple suggestions that can make a huge difference to your skin. She's the one who got my boyfriend into high potency fish oil supplements for his eczema (and changed his skin completely,) as well as introducing me to the benefits of double cleansing; Caroline was also the woman who introduced us all to the wonder benefits of Pixi Glow Tonic, and as a result has had an incredibly close relationship with the brand over the years. It was a natural fit for them to team up for her debut (and much anticipated) skincare product, and even more natural for it to involve double cleansing. The result of this partnership is an effective, affordable and innovative looking cleanser that's sure to be a sell-out when it launches in January.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-E0x2rcR4vfw\/WFpzY593L-I\/AAAAAAAAiJE\/W4RqThS7JRcCPna_4JqB7szbueyhT3RHwCLcB\/s1600\/Caroline%2BHirons%2BTeams%2BUp%2BWith%2BPixi%2BBeauty%2BFor%2BThe%2BUltimate%2BDouble%2BCleanse%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EOne side of this little pot features a solid oil cleanser to remove makeup and impurities with ease, without any greasy residue on the surface of skin, while the other offers a cream cleanser to help remove any last impurities and leave skin feeling supple. I adore balm and oil cleansers and this is no exception: the solid texture melts upon contact with the skin to leave behind a rich oil that glides over the surface with ease. Although cleansing creams aren't my fave, this provides a great way to finish off your cleansing routine and is perfectly suited for all skin types. Caroline has ensured this is a product that everyone can use (removing any fragrances and making it cruelty free,) but it's in no way generic or underwhelming; if anything, this is what you need to get you excited about cleansing again.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EThe only downside for me is that we'll all tend to use more of the solid oil than the cream cleanser, meaning you may be left with more of one than the other - however, the fact that this little pot includes two products makes it perfect for \u003Cspan style=\"color: #0000ee;\"\u003Etraveling\u003C\/span\u003E or trial. Both of these cleansers are brand new to the Pixi brand and haven't just been re-jigged from existing products; Caroline told me herself that she thoroughly checked the ingredients against the brand's INCI listings to ensure there was no cross-over! Her reputation depends on these kind of details, so it's good to know she was thoroughly involved from beginning to end. Many blogger collaborations involve little more than a name printed on-pack and a rather large cheque being cashed at the bank, but for me this is as authentic and natural as it gets.

As Christmas gets closer and closer I've started to unwind and have even taken a few days off just to wrap presents, wander around town, get my hair cut or snuggle on the sofa wrapped in a blanket with a cup of tea...

Usually I'd spend those few days between Christmas and New Year prepping and planning, uploading new posts and taking advantage of the relatively quiet social media platforms to get ahead; right now I can't imagine picking up work until the New Year, simply just because.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis is the only time of year the majority of us get the opportunity to refresh our bodies and minds, preparing for a whole new year and the challenges it brings, so I hope you'll all take a leaf out of my book and make the most of it. Burning the candle at both ends only works until they meet in the middle (and our metaphorical fingers get burned.)

At first glance it looked the same as many other things I'd seen before, but the accompanying literature told a different story: this was \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.beautypie.com\/uk\/join-beauty-pie\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBeauty Pie\u003C\/a\u003E and it claimed to be the driving force behind an industry revolution. Developed by the woman behind super successful brands including Bliss and Soap \u0026amp; Glory, Beauty Pie is an online-only digital members club that aims to bring 'luxury cosmetics at factory prices' to those that sign up. At a cost of £10.00 per month (for a minimum of three months,) being a member allows you to buy £100 worth of cosmetics (at the full price) for rock bottom prices every calendar month - and if you don't use your allowance, it rolls over.

Just pop the list into Google and it's easy to see what kind of quality you can expect: Future Lipstick Matte has basically the exact same ingredients as Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution and Soap \u0026amp; Glory Sexy Mother Pucker Matte; Uber Curl Drama Mascara is almost the same as best selling mascaras from Urban Decay and Clarins; the Beauty Pie Smart Powder Blush is comparable to Topshop and Models Own, while the Brightening Micro Mineral Serum Foundation has strong similarities with Arbonne and Dior. With lipsticks from £2.16, mascara from £1.93, blusher from £2.52 and foundation from £4.76 it's starting to sound like a win-win situation.

That's a total of £25.57 for five items of makeup, before shipping (£2.99 standard and £6.06 express) and handling costs (charged at 1.8% of your total order.

However, you're limited by what Beauty Pie can offer and whether or not you like it. I've tried the products and they're certainly pleasurable and effective, but they don't leave me feeling bowled-over or like I would need to order everything from within their repertoire; they don't have that addictive quality that brands like Makeup Revolution have proven to capture, nor have they been able to bottle the luxurious covetable element that some of the more premiums brands have. \u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ETHE REALITY OF MARKETING\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EMy biggest question of all is around the marketing of Beauty Pie. Who says these are super luxury cosmetics and who sets their 'non member' pricing?\u0026nbsp; If you're not a member you can buy their cosmetics at inflated prices that are actually rather ridiculous: £30.00 for a highlighter, £24.00 for a primer or £19.00 for a lipgloss. These prices are around the same as brands including Bobbi Brown, Dior and Chanel, but in my opinion either the quality doesn't compare or the feeling you get from opening a super luxurious product isn't there. In their own words they 'remove the markup' and reduce the cost of packaging, so I'm just not sure how they can justify these prices - other than to cleverly make it look like you're getting an incredible deal. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EIn the interests of research, I did a little \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LBQblog\/status\/810568604353757184\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETwitter survey\u003C\/a\u003E to gather your thoughts on this new concept; unsurprisingly the comments and feedback was varied, with 38% saying it sounded amazing but getting confused about the fact that it was own-brand only. 23% stated that it was too much money to commit to, while a further 23% said they weren't brand loyal enough to commit; a further 16% just didn't get it. For me, it's a fascinating development in the way we buy beauty and proves that there are many exciting shake-ups to come for the industry, but my gut feeling is that this will go the way of beauty boxes: initial intrigue, excitement and a rush of sign-ups will be replaced after six months with customers becoming lethargic, unsatisfied and desperate for something new.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EI've seen coverage on the concept across publications including The Telegraph, Glamour and Vogue, but none of it mentions the downside or the fact Beauty Pie involves a heavy commitment.

With the birth of online shopping and digital media, it's possible to discover new things and have them arrive on your doorstep within 24 hours; we're a fickle old bunch who are undoubtedly driven by innovation and 'oooh that's pretty!' Asking people to commit to one brand, that's completely unknown, for a minimum period of three months and pay for the privilege (and having a restriction on the amount of items you can actually buy) just sets off too many alarm bells for me. I'm fascinated to see how Beauty Pie evolves over the next year and what products they have up their sleeves; I'm intrigued to see how people will respond after a couple of orders and whether or not trial will drive repeat purchases; I'm also excited for what this means for the industry - because thinking outside of the box is never a bad thing.

It's a great price for the number of shades and it provides a great intro to Urban Decay lipsticks, but best of all: it just looks hot. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-f9pXHSjLfRI\/WFF8uAh4LdI\/AAAAAAAAiGI\/zEuiwF6QrnUZ6_KgfXbNwtzFmwomPzxqACEw\/s1600\/The%2BLuxe%2BLife%2BPerfect%2BTreats%2BFor%2BThe%2BWoman%2BWho%2BLoves%2BLuxury%2B5.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/Lancome-Audacity-in-London-eye-palette_1914282\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ELancome Audacity In London Palette\u003C\/a\u003E (£42.00)\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EI'm so over the Naked eyeshadows; I want something a little more exciting and indulgent.

Because sometimes it's just good to have something pretty on your fireplace.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhich of these five have you got your sights on this Christmas? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-U0zjXfyUA1g\/WFF0LhX5dTI\/AAAAAAAAiFE\/sgUsLvbXAbUmcVYzB9RLz_crIS5WuwFvACLcB\/s1600\/Five%2BFestive%2BCandles%2BThat%2BWill%2BWarm%2BYour%2BHome%2BThis%2BWinter%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-52yE0XIXW-w\/WFF0JDBAFaI\/AAAAAAAAiE8\/bOZg6Ygcm3M8vuWQky1wx3C5HkXbH4GZgCLcB\/s1600\/Five%2BFestive%2BCandles%2BThat%2BWill%2BWarm%2BYour%2BHome%2BThis%2BWinter%2B%2B3.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-rLukRw1pYL4\/WFF0KyR5l5I\/AAAAAAAAiFA\/E6gTDpiq6sgwQ57NWIuNcv5qZBpmz0fLQCLcB\/s1600\/Five%2BFestive%2BCandles%2BThat%2BWill%2BWarm%2BYour%2BHome%2BThis%2BWinter%2B%2B4.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-ZQpSjV1Fqec\/WFF0TuJRy4I\/AAAAAAAAiFM\/bX3Pho4SRwMR9rVX7kTIT2pX5nyJ694JQCLcB\/s1600\/Five%2BFestive%2BCandles%2BThat%2BWill%2BWarm%2BYour%2BHome%2BThis%2BWinter%2B5.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca class=\"bloglovin-widget\" data-blog-id=\"2158708\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/2158708\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/madmimi.com\/signups\/147076\/join\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESIGN UP TO THE LBQ NEWS BLAST HERE!\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003E \u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Wouldn't it be lovely if your gift was so much more than just another bath bomb or pair of socks - and instead provided them with an opportunity to chillax, pamper themselves and feel good?

Although my baby face keeps me looking younger than my years (and a great gene inheritance which is serving me well,) there are certain areas that I've forgotten about until a visible change becomes apparent; one of those key areas is the neck and décolletage. Even though my under-eye area is holding up well, I've definitely seen my jawline blur somewhat into my neck and leave me with the onset of a double-chin if I don't make a concerted effort to stand correctly. Although I can deal with fine lines and a change in texture, this is an area I'm increasingly concerned about and have more than a vested interest in maintaining. Collectively we have a tendency to focus so much on our complexions that we forget about an area of the body that's notoriously difficult to manage once left untreated; prevention is so much better than cure, but even if you've neglected this area completely over the years - help is at hand.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-7IWl6PuvuxE\/WFKANEhrj8I\/AAAAAAAAiHk\/Eo_hTazu9acshwwt8fbVjdUiH3FPv0YogCLcB\/s1600\/Don%2527t%2BForget%2BYour%2BDecollatage%2BLift%2B%2526%2BFirm%2BYour%2BJawline%2BWith%2BThe%2BNEW%2BCrystal%2BClear%2BRewind%2B10%2BSystem%2B6.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EI've been introduced to the Crystal Clear Rewind 10 Super Sonic Neck Firm and Lift Duo, which is a clinically proven breakthrough anti-ageing neck moisturiser and corresponding sonic applicator designed specifically to lift, firm and restore the neck and décolletage area. The lightweight and delicately scented moisturiser is a powerful formulation in disguise, thanks to the high-performance and 'clinical level active ingredients' that target the sagging effects ageing can have on your neck area. Once applied to the face and neck area, the Sonic Neck Wand can be used to aid penetration and gently lift the skin via sonic energy; the super fast vibrations help to tone the skin and leave it looking rejuvenated practically instantly, helping to provide both short and long-term results. If you're interested in the ingredients that make this effective, then here are the four key ones that work together to make a real difference. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPheohydrane\u003C\/b\u003E is derived from brown algae and combined with acids from microalgae (as well as sea water minerals,) to lock moisture into the skin for several days and acts as a protective second skin.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EUnisteron Y-50 (Phytosteroid Complex)\u003C\/b\u003E works to increase elasticity and smoothes out lines and wrinkles, and is particularly suitable in products when paired with skin-firming and wrinkle smoothing properties.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPhycojuvenine (Algae Extract)\u003C\/b\u003E energises cells, resulting in restoring collagen production for plumper and rejuvenated skin.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EAroleat Samphira\u003C\/b\u003E is taken from sea fennel and imitates the beneficial properties of retinoids (Vitamin A), without causing skin irritation of photosensitivity. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EAlthough I've only tried this a couple of times myself just yet (although it's definitely going to become a daily pleasure from hereon in,) a four week clinical study has proven results independently. Thirty healthy female volunteers with ageing 'non-firm' skin used the system over a month and their results were compared to untreated skin; the findings illustrated that the Crystal Clear Rewind 10 System firmed the neck by 29% and décolletage by 42% in four weeks. I'm a big advocate of facial massage and blood stimulation, having seen great results with eye massagers and jade stones, so this just takes it a step further - and a step lower.

Airbrushed images of stereotypical perfection are practically force-fed to us on a daily basis; everywhere we look there's an incredibly poised and traditionally beautiful woman in her undies attempting to sell us an idea of ultimate confidence. If we just buy that lipstick\/drink that beverage\/wear that dress\/use that face cream we'll become the person we've always wanted to be! I've grown up believing that my body in its natural form is not to be celebrated; if anything it's something to be ashamed of and wrapped away, simply because I don't look like the six foot Amazonian Goddesses that strut down the runway or feature on the front covers of my favourite magazines. Beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, colours and forms, and it's vitally important that women are represented in all their glory - on the telly, in magazines, within the fashion industry and as part of beauty campaigns. None of us are the same and that's what makes us all beautiful; if we were all carbon copies the world would be a very dull place indeed, so it's vitally important that we learn to embrace our imperfections or differences and celebrate them. Whether you've got a wobbly bum, greying hair, laughter lines or all the freckles, you're beautiful just the way you are.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-fGtUj_rGbUQ\/WEgK48dfLjI\/AAAAAAAAiBo\/Q4tH855B3cIM9CM-4oSHdbwW8bni8Pj4ACLcB\/s1600\/The%2BImportance%2BOf%2BDiversity%2BIn%2BBeauty%2B%2528PLUS%2BBecome%2BOne%2BOf%2BDove%2527s%2B%2527Real%2BWomen%2527%2BIn%2BTheir%2BNew%2BCampaign%2521%2529%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EI do find it incredibly frustrating that the beauty industry in particular can be very one-dimensional. It's hard to relate to the images of perfection (that are often so manipulated that they don't actually represent the woman behind the camera,) when I'm struggling with a saggy chin and boobs that seem to have a mind of their own. Although we're seeing more brands embracing diversity, as a whole we've still got a long way to go. The importance of these campaigns is paramount to the mental stability, confidence and attitude of future generations - so that they don't have to battle with the same issues that my peers and I have struggled with. Over the last decade, one of the brands that's been able to establish and continue a thought-provoking conversation on female beauty is undoubtedly Dove. Their campaigns were the first to break down barriers and illustrate that every woman can be beautiful: it's just that they have to believe it from within. When their 'campaign for real beauty' started over ten years ago, women were possibly at their lowest ebb with only around 2% admitting to feeling beautiful; skipping forward via a few viral campaigns (many of whom went viral before 'going viral' was even a thing,) and thankfully that's changed somewhat.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EMore than ever we're happy to embrace our differences, imperfections, wobbly bits, skinny bits and changing bits as we realise life is not defined by the label in our clothing. It's much easier to relate to someone who looks more like us, thanks to the power of the internet and in particular blogs, and for us to truly believe that there is more than one definition of beauty. I've always believed it's so important to see that other women have cellulite, wobbly tums, wonky boobs or toes that stick out of sandals - so that we don't judge ourselves by unrealistic perceptions and measures of what's aesthetically pleasing. Personally I'm incredibly thankful to brands like Dove who are making a positive change, rather than just trying to sell another pot of face cream by prying on our insecurities. I've always adored their 'real women' campaigns as something that makes me feel good, positive and excited about the changes that will inevitably happen to my body in the future.

None of us have the exact same skin type or problematic areas, and with infinite combinations of woes it's increasingly hard to pick up a product off the shelf that's going to address our concerns. Offering products for oily, dry or combination skin is an outdated approach, with more and more brands understanding that you can be all of those things and more - depending what day of the week (or time of the month) it is. We've seen brands already dabble in the area of skin boosting solutions or bottles of product that will help create the perfect match (Clarins \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2hB0r53\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESkin Boosters\u003C\/a\u003E and The Body Shop's \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.thebodyshop.com\/en-gb\/make-up\/foundations-concealers\/shade-adjusting-drops\/p\/p000512?utm_source=Google_PLA\u0026amp;utm_medium=sem_brd\u0026amp;utm_campaign=161004_PXShoppingBrandMakeUp\u0026amp;utm_term=%7bKeyWordTerm%7d\u0026amp;utm_content=GenericTrade\u0026amp;gclid=CPyfk_zD8dACFbEy0wodUBUN9A\u0026amp;dclid=CMLEn_zD8dACFc-u7Qod7yMOCw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EShade Adjusting Drops\u003C\/a\u003E are a couple of great examples,) but in 2017 this trend is only going to get bigger.

Although they don't have the most easy  to understand names, descriptions or directions, The Ordinary (\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/2016\/10\/the-skincare-brand-thats-anything-but.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eread my original feature here\u003C\/a\u003E) has made  hi-tech skincare affordable and achievable no matter your budget. What's so exciting is that these little bottles take the ingredients  that make a difference and formulate them in such a way that they can be  added into any skincare regime with ease; you no longer need a dermatologist to help you on your way - all it takes is a little research and understanding of what your skin is craving. If you love the idea of this new beauty movement but aren't all too sure how to use these little bottles of skin-loving ingredients, here are the three main ways to easily integrate them into your regime. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EADD THEM TO YOUR MOISTURISER\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EIf you're looking at that bottle every morning and aren't really sure where to begin, then adding a few drops into your moisturiser is a great way to boost the performance of your existing products without having to invest in a whole new step. Add in the recommended dosage (usually between a pea-sized amount and a couple of generous drops) into a small amount of moisturiser on the palm of your hand, mixing thoroughly before applying it as usual. Just make sure your face cream doesn't contain any ingredients that will break down your skin booster or cause it to be ineffective (i.e. don't add a Retinol concentrate into a Vitamin C enriched base as they require different a pH to remain stable.) \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELAYER THEM UP\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EMy personal preference is to thoroughly enjoy the application experience and layer up my singular ingredients to ensure they can get to work most effectively. In the morning I'll start with an essence, massage in a Vitamin C or radiance boosting concentrate, add my serum over the top alongside a moisturiser, finally finishing with an SPF. At night, I always use a Retinol concentrate underneath my usual overnight treatment for a little boost. This may sound like a lot, but if you don't overdo it (a few drops of each will suffice) then you can easily massage in each layer and prep for the next without overloading skin. This ensures maximum effectiveness and allows each layer to get to work on a slight delay, rather than chucking it all on at once.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EMIX AND MATCH DAILY\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EIf you can wake up almost every day and see something completely different in the mirror, then it may be time to get creative.

It's amazing the difference a small change can make to our routines, but the biggest for me has been the application techniques I've now perfected with the help of a few expert tools. Makeup brushes really are an essential, even if you rarely wear foundation and have only marginally more skill than your cat; they help to provide an even and professional application, a polished finish and a perfected look that's incomparable to one created with only the use of your digits.

Here's what you need to know in order to shop for your tools efficiently and without spending your monthly Starbucks allowance on one blending brush. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003EGOOD QUALITY \u0026amp; SYMMETRICAL COMPONENTS \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EIt may look pretty, but that rose gold instagrammable brush you're coveting may not be any good. Look beyond the aesthetics of your tools and opt for those with good quality components that are comfortable in the hand. According to the experts, you need to find a brush with symmetrical bristles (so no odd ones sticking out of the top) and a handle that's not too heavy and not too light; always look at the ferrule too (the metal bit that joins the brush to the handle) and ensure it's firmly in place. (A great example is this \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gMTlJC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EQVS Flat Top Powder Brush\u003C\/a\u003E, £6.99, which is constructed perfectly for purpose.) \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003ESYNTHETIC VS NATURAL HAIR\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EThe type of hair used is important to note if you're working with creamy  textures and liquid foundations. Natural hairs tend to absorb the  liquid and waste product unnecessarily, while simultaneously harvesting  bacteria that like to live in these warm and cosy environments.  Foundation brushes should be synthetic (often described as nylon  bristles) to ensure they keep their shape, while powder brushes (used  with eyeshadow or blusher) tend to perform better when made with natural  hair. Wise up on what you should be buying, rather than spending on impulse. (This \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gYVAar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EQVS Foundation Brush\u003C\/a\u003E, £7.50, is made with synthetic nylon bristles to minimise wastage and maximise hygiene.)\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY NEED? \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EAlthough those fancy fan-looking brushes may make you look the part, if you don't know how to use them or they're just taking up valuable room on your dressing table because they look pretty, what's the point? Always start your collection with the basics (such as a foundation, brow, eyeshadow and blending brush) and add to it as you get to grips with each in turn; you don't want to be intimidated and avoid using them altogether. If you don't need 18 types of eyeshadow brush, then don't buy them; realistically it's always better to have a capsule collection than investing in a pro kit that doesn't get used.

Although some smaller sets can provide value and help boost your collection quickly, you want to avoid anything that's offering more than five brushes in one go.

Organic was theoretically a good idea, but it undoubtedly cost a premium and often involved less than pleasant formulas with a tendency to separate if they were left on your dressing table for too long. Rather fortunately for us, things have changed. Organic skincare is now readily available, as well as being affordable, and provides results that mean you don't have to compromise on efficacy or the sensorial experience that's so closely associated with our beauty regimes. I've never been one to be overly concerned with turning down a product (or meal) because it's not organic, but if we're presented with organic goods that do an equally good (or sometimes better) job then it's a no brainer; why would I want to use an overtly chemical lotion or potion if there was an equally good organic version?

Furthermore, all the Avalon Organics packaging is made from recycled materials and sustainably sourced paperboard - as well as being recyclable after use. They're a perfect example of a brand that provides affordable beauty products (starting at only £4.49) while providing solutions that are both a pleasure to use and truly effective.

What started as a passion for nail varnish and hair serum has evolved into a full blown career, where I'm able to work with some of my favourite brands and experience things that money simply can't buy, as well as making friends with some of the most awesome and empowering women I've ever come across. Over nearly seven years I've curated my own (multi-award winning!) corner of the 'net, which I'm wholeheartedly proud of; love and passion is injected into every blog post that goes live, which is reflected in the amazing community of readers (you guys rock) that seem to regularly return for a little bit more. But the journey over that time hasn't necessarily been an easy one; there are pitfalls and downsides as much as there are highlights and freedom when it comes to working for yourself - in any capacity. The late nights, early mornings, weekends spent catching up and the daily struggle to get that shot in when the winter sun goes down at 3pm, just for starters.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-6v8PFsuzyp0\/WE56A-RyXTI\/AAAAAAAAiDw\/s-8Q0zFoOJI1DYOSOnPdWnw107PHPCi5QCLcB\/s1600\/A%2BWord%2BAbout%2BWhat%2BReally%2BMakes%2BA%2BChristmas%2BCollection%2BSpecial%2B%2528And%2BBobbi%2BBrown%2527s%2BVery%2BBeautiful%2BOffering%2529%2B2016%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EBlogging as an industry seems to be capturing the attention of the world  more so than ever, but often it's put on a pedestal as an easy and  glossy way for millennials to make their fortune; conveniently the  struggles and challenges we face are often overlooked, giving it an  unrealistic perception that can leave young men and women disheartened  when reality hits. Yes it's an amazing way to connect with like-minded individuals, share a passion, hone new skills and have a bit of a side hustle (who doesn't love to make money from what they love!) but realistically, 2017 won't be the year that any of us make our millions. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIT'S HARDER THAN THE MEDIA MAKE OUT\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EThe young and impressionable may be forgiven for believing they're only ever a hop, skip and a jump away from earning their first million via the internet. The media has a tendency to belittle what we do while simultaneously making it sound super easy to make your fortune; if the Daily Mail were to be believed, all we'd need is a laptop and a pair of fairy lights to become the next Zoella. Truth be told, it's a lot harder than that.

Every day thousands more open up their own site and start writing about their passion points, but that makes it harder and harder to stand out. Although it's not impossible by any means, your favourite bloggers managed to capture the attention of their audience early on and retain them indefinitely - and that has value to brands. Increasingly collaborations are based on influence and engagement rather than pure numbers, but with a million different sites to choose from it's becoming increasingly hard to nab those campaigns. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EYOU NOW NEED A POINT OF DIFFERENCE\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EAn endless stream of consciousness is no longer enough; if there's one thing that the most successful bloggers have in common, then it's their ability to carve a niche or cement a point of difference. As more and more magazines close their doors, we're turning online for our hit of aspirational imagery and editorial content - and we always want something more. Although copycatting is prevalent in the bloggersphere like never before (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but heck it's annoying!) it's not enough if you want to work commercially. Feeds that are full of nothing but product feature after product feature get tired very quickly and readers increasingly want a way to escape from the daily grind, if only for a few minutes; review after review doesn't meet that need, so it's never been more important to ensure you have a point of difference.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBUT THE GOOD NEWS IS....\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EThe fundamental relationship between blogger, reader and brand is evolving. There's never been such an opportunity to create something unique and get it in front of people that want to know about it. Brands increasingly are looking for 'micro-influencers' (the buzz word of the moment which essentially means those with a following of 10-100k,) understanding that they have more influence over purchasing decisions than the mega-stars that are now practically celebrities. You no longer have to fit in a box or standard category, as readers want to feel connected to the bloggers they follow - and involved in every element of their lives.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EThirty-plus bloggers are proving that it's not just a young girls game anymore; stylish women are having children and proving there's more to mummy blogging than we may think; men are increasingly seeing the value of blogging and the opportunities it brings. 2017 is the year we can make this industry exactly what we want it to be, with no constraints.

This year we've got our tickets to Rogue One booked and we're ready to re-visit a Galaxy Far Far Away once again; Star Wars season is undoubtedly upon us and is becoming somewhat of a festive tradition! Since the first film was launched back in December 1977, a whole universe has captured our imaginations and had an impact on every element of popular culture. It was a film franchise like no other, proving that a female lead character didn't have to be a damsel in distress (in fact, she could kick some butt and save the day herself,) and the shiny heroes were more flawed than any that came before them.

What I really like about the Star Wars fragrances is that they've been developed with a slightly older and more sophisticated customer in mind than you may expect, mirrored by the elegant and simplistic bottle design. From the moment you open it, the bottle provides an experience - especially as it's held within a little storybook that you'll definitely want to keep. You wouldn't be embarrassed to pop this on your dressing table, and every Star Wars fan would be pleased to find one of these wrapped up under their tree come Christmas. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-fGHPpj117IQ\/WEamGwt2M1I\/AAAAAAAAiAc\/w4QdM60nhjsa85Qvz2Ii0KdaA-YP8ymigCEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B3.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-ZDJUk-SdG5Y\/WEal5KriY6I\/AAAAAAAAiAI\/NO41nT7erhUze02MKt473OLgKeiKx3S0wCEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B%2B6.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-6xrIoHwhrWk\/WEanRGeBxlI\/AAAAAAAAiAo\/aaVZOfFZmcwxJWhBxTB6aFpArHt-FuJsgCEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B4.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-UbADk8E9a4M\/WEamIh83DgI\/AAAAAAAAiAg\/zNDfN7PkL0EXWCjBn3Zgea6FBqBegqHywCEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B8.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-GV-I5RmujUw\/WEamBJOucWI\/AAAAAAAAiAU\/br1JcWAqWXwwMpL7evj_rQadDSiTtCngQCEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B12.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-kaXGRCLe3dw\/WEal4KjpZYI\/AAAAAAAAiAE\/iV6tcmNfw3o0OBCcU1Oyi_F8HVFYo35WQCEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B%2B11.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-pSy2G93WoG8\/WEamC2xz9VI\/AAAAAAAAiAY\/HArpgie7u10TSEqizFLDI05fX4pdn2d1ACEw\/s1600\/Taking%2BYou%2BTo%2BThe%2BDark%2B%2528Or%2BLight%2529%2BSide%2BStar%2BWars%2BLaunch%2BSIX%2BNew%2BUnisex%2BScents%2BFit%2BFor%2BAny%2BSuper-Fan%2B%2B2.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003EThe Star Wars fragrance collection is available now from \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/Star-Wars-REY-50ml-Eau-de-Parfum_1932898\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBoots.com\u003C\/a\u003E priced from £27.50.\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe Light \u0026amp; Dark side duo is priced £45.00 for the pair.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThis is a sponsored post on behalf of Star Wars fragrances; all opinions are my own. \u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cscript src=\"https:\/\/widget.bloglovin.com\/widget\/scripts\/bl.js\" type=\"text\/javascript\"\u003E\u003C\/script\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Ca class=\"bloglovin-widget\" data-blog-id=\"2158708\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/2158708\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/widget\/bilder\/en\/widget.gif?id=2158708\" \/\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/i\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/madmimi.com\/signups\/147076\/join\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ESIGN UP TO THE LBQ NEWS BLAST HERE!\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Ci\u003E \u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

And then the festive season hits and it becomes ten times worse. No matter how organised I think I am, in the run up to Christmas there's always too much to prepare and far too many things to do before we can finally switch off and crack open a bottle of bubbly. The holidays are always so much fun, but they can also be incredibly stressful as us modern women have so many roles to juggle and put so much pressure on ourselves to pull off the perfect occasion. From November onward we're often so focused on making the festivities the best they can be and pleasing everyone around us, that it's easy to forget to look after ourselves; in order to pull off a spread that Mary Berry would be proud of, it's important that we all take a step back and take a moment of 'me time'.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-J46UouGLfwg\/WEaHEwPRDrI\/AAAAAAAAh_w\/xFjRorcrckAtApeesUKBV26kRsbmZHLqgCLcB\/s1600\/Moments%2BOf%2BMe%2BTime%2BWe%2BShould%2BAll%2BTake%2BTime%2BOut%2BThis%2BFestive%2BSeason%2BTo%2BIndulge%2BIn%2BThe%2BLittle%2BThings%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EOur overall well-being is paramount (and in the bigger scheme of things so much more important than a perfectly decorated tree or beautifully roasted turkey,) so as we step a little closer to the Big Day I'm taking a moment to remind you why it's always a good idea to treat yourself with those indulgent little things. Palmolive are a brand that understand this completely. Their Gourmet Body Butter Shower Creams have been created to provide a multi-sensorial shower experience \u2028that not only cleanses, but provides an invigorating experience alongside deliciously scented and velvety soft skin; you could say they're the ultimate shower treat for body and mind.

But it got me thinking - what other ways can we embrace a little 'me time' and take back moments for ourselves this holiday season?

As a huge Harry Potter fan, when this opened up a few years ago my sister and I were practically the first in line to check it out - and we certainly weren't disappointed. From the moment you first catch a glimpse of the iconic Great Hall, to the closing breathtaking view of Hogwarts Castle, every moment is magical; so much so that I recently stopped by for the eighth time. (Is that a little excessive?) If you haven't been before, then the Warner Bros Studio Tour is home to all the sets, props, costumes and creatures from all eight of the Harry Potter films; the self-guided experience is a must for any fans of the franchise, as you can completely immerse yourself in the wonder of the Wizarding World. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-Iq3p94quP9k\/WEANa_FwOfI\/AAAAAAAAh9s\/KQyGGMJ1mZIiS_gyILtdRd9k0yTiCzzbgCEw\/s1600\/hogwarts%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bsnow%2Bharry%2Bpotter%2Bwarner%2Bbros%2Bstudio%2Btour.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EIt's the only place in the world you can see all of the amazing detail  that went into the films, and once a year it transforms into something  even more special with the launch of Hogwarts In The Snow. For a two  month period over Christmas (from late November until late January,) all  the sets are dressed for the holidays - including the Christmas feast  in the Great Hall, the slightly shabby looking tinsel in Harry and Ron's  bedroom and even a sprinkling of snow all over the giant model used for  aerial shots of the castle. From the moment you step through those iconic wooden doors, here's why you'll have a permenant smile across your face and will leave feeling totally in the Christmas spirit... \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETHERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW\u003Cbr \/\u003EI've been back to Hogwarts eight times now, and there's always something new to see. The lot is constantly expanding and evolving, so no two visits are ever the same. Even in the last six months they've expanded one of the main rooms and have added flying quidditch players alongside new sets and experiences, so there's always a reason to return. With Fantastic Beasts now starting a whole new franchise of its own, the experience is only going to get bigger. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETHE GREAT HALL IS A FANTASTIC SPECTACLE\u003Cbr \/\u003EPossibly the most instantly recogniseable set of all time, the Great Hall is just as you imagine it to be - and right now it's filled with Christmas trees, flaming puddings and food that looks a little too realistic. Could it get any better? There's nowhere that can compete with how festive it feels.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESIP YOUR BUTTERBEER OUT IN THE COLD\u003Cbr \/\u003ENow I know this is a hotly contested issue (you either love or hate Butterbeer,) but this is the only place in the UK you can sip on a fluffy glass of the Wizard's favourite drink. I personally much prefer the sweeter warming beverage you can taste in Universal Studios, but it's all about getting in the spirit; take your cup outside and take in the scenery like you're an extra in your favourite film... \u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIT ACTUALLY SNOWS!\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhich takes me onto my next point: it actually snows! The clever people at Warner Bros have managed to install a snow machine that goes off every few minutes during this season to make it look like it's snowing; the results are quite breathtaking. When you touch it it's clear that it's just foam bubbles, but when you're standing there taking it in there's nothing to compare it to.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESEE HOGWARTS CASTLE AT ITS BEST\u003Cbr \/\u003EHow many times have we all wished we attended Hogwarts, rather than our dreary muggle secondary schools that held less magic than that magicians starter-kit you bought from Argos? The entire castle was actually constructed for ariel shots of the school, giving the films depth and a sprinkling of something special; the tour ends with an opportunity to walk around it 360 degrees while listening to the iconic music we've come to instantly recognise. You'll leave with goosebumps (via the gift shop of course.) \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHave you paid the Warner Bros Studio Tour a visit? Is it still on your wishlist this year?\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E(PS: I didn't want to ruin it if you've yet to visit, so the pictures below give you just a taster!) \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Fast forward a decade and we're now a generation that whole-heartedly embraces recycling, locally sourced produce, picking up a bargain in Primark or sourcing an old piece of furniture to re-purpose from Gumtree. Being thrifty has never been more on-trend, and sites such as Pinterest and Etsy provide us with endless inspiration and ways of turning someones trash into our own treasure. Not only is getting crafty a fun way to spend an afternoon, but creating something that was born from your own hands makes the end result even more satisfying; calligraphy, card making and knitting have all seen a resurgence in the last few years, as we look to channel our creative streaks in new ways. This Christmas Burt's Bees have made every effort to ensure their festive gifting is re-useable and recyclable; (is any of it made from recycled materials?) with some of their best selling and classic skincare treats being packaged in tins, boxes, cosmetic pouches and zippable containers, you can make use of the vessel well after you've finished the products. If you need some inspiration to help you turn these festive containers into something more exciting, then I've got some ideas to get you in the spirit. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-p4duvlviT7E\/WERGWafRuLI\/AAAAAAAAh-s\/zhs1FgPOHZE3ZfIuVU_IKVucZGC5IF3iwCLcB\/s1600\/Being%2BThrifty%2BHas%2BNever%2BBeen%2BMore%2BOn-Trend%2BHow%2BYou%2BCan%2BRe-Use%2BYour%2BBurt%25E2%2580%2599s%2BBees%2BPackaging%2BIn%2B2017%2B2.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENIGHT LIGHT\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EThe super cute honey jar that comes free with the \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.burtsbees.co.uk\/natural-products\/gifts-and-kits-all-gift-sets\/treat-from-the-bees-christmas-gift-pot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ETreats From The Bees\u003C\/a\u003E gift set (£7.99) is perfect to re-purpose into a little side table nightlight.

For such small, short-lived creatures, bees do a lot to keep the Earth in balance - helping to make approximately a third of our food supply, as well as keeping all kinds of spices, medicines and essential greenery flourishing. According to the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.bbka.org.uk\/kids\/importance_of_bees\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EBritish Beekeepers Association\u003C\/a\u003E, the economic value of bees as pollinators of commercially grown insect-pollinated crops in the UK has been estimated at over £200 million per year; that’s a lot to be dependent on these stripy little creatures. Despite their importance, bees are in danger of disappearing from our environment - particularly due to the loss of natural habitats from modern farming practices, as well as the varroa mite that attacks honey bees and has killed the majority of the wild colonies. Our fluffy yellow and black friends need all the help they can get, so it's a good job brands such as Burt's Bees are making such a concerted effort to give their little communities a much-needed boost.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-ovwZc3fwrSM\/WD8L26vNPuI\/AAAAAAAAh78\/kotqwm5exKs2Qb9SvKAj3SBx-7ncSUMtQCLcB\/s1600\/A%2BBee%2BIs%2BFor%2BLife%252C%2BNot%2BJust%2BFor%2BChristmas%2BWhy%2BThese%2BStripey%2BCreatures%2BAre%2BEssential%2BTo%2BOur%2BWellbeing%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EHOW DOES BEE POLLINATION WORK? \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EIf you can’t recall from GCSE biology, pollination is essentially the transfer of pollen from the male part of the flower (the anther) to the female part of the flower (the stigma). When the two meet, a plant’s seed or suit is formed. Although some plants can pollinate themselves or rely on the wind to give them a helping hand, others need animals to assist with the process. Bees are great pollinators because they tend to focus their energy on one species of plant at a time; this means much higher quality pollination occurs, with all plants of one species are getting an even distribution of vital pollen from others of its same species. Without the help of our bee friends, our every day food supply would look very different.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EHONEY TO THE BEE\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlthough it’s a food product created by bees and intended to be used as a food store for their hive during the winter, it’s a food product that us humans are rather fond of too.

I love picking out things I think my loved ones will adore, or introducing them to new brands I know they'll become fans of throughout the rest of the next year. The Christmas period is the perfect opportunity to change things up and encourage the women (and men) in your life to establish a great beauty regime, so they can stick with those great habits in the months to come. Often we don't value our own skin enough to treat it to products and routines that will do it some good - but giving the gift of great skin is something your loved ones will cherish long beyond the start of 2017. Burt's Bees have a fruitful and exciting portfolio of natural gifts this Christmas, all of which work as great introductions to the brand as well as re-introductions to those that already love what Burt has to offer; they're so deliciously tempting that you'll even want to ask Santa for them yourself! If you want to make a New Year's resolution to adopt a more natural approach to your beauty regime, then this is a great way to start: simple, effective and affordable body and skincare products all wrapped up in beautiful boxes that don't even require extra wrapping.

Many lip balms are enriched with irritating ingredients or components that actually exacerbate the situation (including excessive scents, preservatives or colouring,) leaving our lips in an even more worse condition than before. However, Burt's Bees classic formulas are made of 100% natural ingredients and nourishing beeswax that's harvested to seal in moisture and add a touch of lubrication. Available in a  multitude of flavours and offering a huge array of benefits, these  little wonder tubes are well deserving recipients of my 'best lip balm ever' accolade - so much so that there's always at least one (if not two or three) in my bag or coat pocket. There's no doubt they're a Winter essential, but what about other ways you can inject a little Burt's Bees balm into your festive season? I've got my thinking cap on just for you to list out ten alternative things you can do with your tube of nourishing balm this Christmas to inject a little Bee-utiful goodness into your day.

If you've already got your crackers picked out, gently undo one end without popping the snapper in the middle and swap the little rubbish gifts for a balm instead.

Using a small amount of yarn or ribbon, attach your chosen balm to your gift alongside a gift tag and festive garnish (bells, twigs, tinsel and candy canes work brilliantly) and make your presents even more tempting to rip open.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESPIN THE BALM\u003Cbr \/\u003EYou've heard of spin the bottle, but what about spin the balm? Use your tube to pick out someone during truth or dare, or if you're more into family-friendly party games just pick the next person to have a go at Pictionary. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EBURT'S INSPIRED CANAPES\u003Cbr \/\u003EThanks to the creativity of the Burt's Bees team there are SO many flavours to get your juices flowing. Why not use their flavour combinations as inspiration for canapes or festive treats - including a Blueberry \u0026amp; Dark Chocolate tart, Ginger Spice biscuits, Coconut \u0026amp; Pear bowls or Vanilla Bean macarons? Just serve alongside the balm that inspired it all!\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EDONATE TO THE BEES\u003Cbr \/\u003EAll out of gift inspiration this Christmas? Why not donate to the British Beekeeping Association on your loved ones behalf and give them a little tube of Burt's Bees balm as a token to explain the gesture. It's a gift that will surprise, delight and make a difference all year long. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESTOCKING SURPRISES\u003Cbr \/\u003ETurn over a healthy new leaf this holiday season and swap the usual chocolates and sweets found at the bottom of every stocking for a little tube of hydrating and soothing balm instead. Suitable for the whole family, it's an affordable way to show you care while not helping to overdose on sugar.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EPOP IT IN YOUR POCKETS\u003Cbr \/\u003EAre your lips always feeling a bit parched, but you're never within easy reach of a lip balm? Overcome that problem by stocking up on all your favourite flavours and popping them in every coat pocket you own.

We all love spending our hard-earned cash on bits and bobs to make our Christmases feel all that more festive, but as soon as the New Year hits the decorations come down and that holiday tat becomes just that: bits of stuff we'd rather get rid of than store away for another twelve months. If you want to make a concerted effort to embrace DIY, make use of some of the bits and bobs you've got lying around and get crafty this Christmas, then this is the right place for you! There are so many great ideas to make your festive season all the more personal and hands-on (so much so that I've made a Pinterest board full of inspiration,) but I've picked the ones I've fallen head-over-heels for to show you - and prove how easy it is to create something truly heart-warming without having to spend a fortune. Whether you're a craft-nerd at hard or a complete novice, there are lots of ways you can get creative and give your loved ones a more unique holiday season than what they're used to.

Although it's increasingly on-trend for brands to offer a natural formula, and source their ingredients ethically and sustainably, few can say they've been doing it for the over thirty years. Burt's Bees started life as creative candles that used up the leftover beeswax from Burt's hives (yes, he was an actual person!) adding the iconic lipbalm we know and love into the line up in 1991; since then the business has expanded beyond lip balm into colour cosmetics and skincare, but one thing has always underpinned their values - a belief in the power of nature and the infinite resources nature provides. That ethos has informed the way that the brand sources ingredients (and respects the communities, individuals and environments from which they're sourced,) and the way that Burt’s Bees formulates all products to nourish the life of your skin.\u0026nbsp; From beeswax to baobab, clary sage to shea butter, everything that goes into a Burt's Bees product benefits the body. There's so much more to this brand than you may already know, and I'm here to help tell that story... \u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-Odz6XNBNK8o\/WDg2UkeKFbI\/AAAAAAAAh1U\/qhvFOkx81B4NmacTIWD8tF6OgOG6BhJTgCLcB\/s1600\/Giving%2BComes%2BNaturally%2BWith%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BGet%2BTo%2BKnow%2BThe%2BBees%2BBehind%2BThe%2BBrand%2B%2B3.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cb\u003EBORN FROM NATURE\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EBurt’s Bees looks to the power of nature to inform how they make products. In their words\u0026nbsp; \"nature has billions of years of research for us to tap into!\" Evolving and resilient, plants have had to continually adapt and develop their own chemistry to maintain vitality in the face of changing environmental conditions - including dryness, humidity, freezing temperatures and excessive heat. Do these challenges sound familiar? We’ve evolved with nature and human DNA is more similar to plants than different; we share around 60% of the same DNA as a banana plant! Many component in our bodies have similar components in nature (for example sebum and jojoba oil,) so Burt’s Bees skin friendly yet powerful ingredients to make their products truly effective.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECOMMUNITY SOURCED\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EIn 2012 Burt’s Bees launched an initiative that was focused on identifying key ingredients that were fundamental to the brand, selecting regions where those ingredients were produced and forming strong, mutually beneficial partnerships with communities in these regions. One of the first projects focuses on sourcing 50% of the beeswax required for the Burt’s Bees lip balms from Tanzania, using a combination of new and traditional methods. Their goal is to source 100% of Burt’s beeswax from communities and expand the program to include other natural oils, waxes and butters - so buying from the brand does more good than just giving you great skin.

The aim of this foundation is to empower grassroots initiatives, particularly in the areas of protecting honeybees and supporting sustainable agriculture. Since its inception, The Greater Good Foundation has issued $1.2 million in grants which will inevitably help to make a real difference in the years to come.

Sat around the tree, sipping on a cup of hot chocolate while listing to carols, popping open the board games and feeling like you're on the front of a Christmas card. Realistically though, that picture perfect image doesn't always translate into reality; the holidays are known to be the period of the year that cause the most arguments, unsurprisingly because were all in close proximity. For the rest of the year we all have our own independence, schedules and space, but when you chuck people together indefinitely (that often only see each other every few months) the living room can become a pressure cooker. If in the run up to the big event you need some space to breathe and prepare, or you want to spend the holidays away from everything completely, there are some great destinations that will help you get in the festive spirit without the possibility of a family row. Booking yourself a last minute getaway to help perk your mood, use up those last few days of holiday or provide an escape from the stresses and strains of the season is always a good idea!

We've seen it in so many festive movies that it's become synonymous with Christmas, the ice skating rink below looking like a postcard too.

Although a slowcooker and matching tea towel may seem like a good idea at the time, the truth is we all want to be indulged in a way that makes us feel special. If your partner (or loved ones in general) is a bit useless at picking out something you'll genuinely love and use, then you may want to give them a helping hand. It's widely understood that male and female brains work differently, so it's worth taking into account how we process information in order to understand if those hints are really sticking. (Spoiler: they're probably not.) What's a really obvious hint to you may not be to them, while a thoughtful gift to them may seem like an insulting nightmare to you. I'm a firm believer in providing a short list of suggestions, rather than leaving them to their own devices and getting all in a tizz - this way I've ended up with gifts I've treasured and used all year round, rather than things that end up stuck in the spare room never to be used again. If you're wondering how to get your partner to buy you the perfect gift this festive season, then I've some bits of advice to help you on your way.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-71RK0PndmLA\/WDgl52yjCvI\/AAAAAAAAh0k\/SIhrYRkMAHQsuHeOiuAsh7so-x1z0tdDgCLcB\/s1600\/How%2BTo%2BGet%2BYour%2BPartner%2BTo%2BBuy%2BYou%2BThe%2BPerfect%2BGift%2BThis%2BChristmas%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPOST-IT NOTE THOSE BITS\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EIf you've seen things you'd really love to receive over the festive period, get out those post-its and highlighter pens and mark them all out.

I've done my research and have created three drinks which are full of goodness and low in sugar, so you can feel just as Christmassy but not as conscious-striken.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-CM25G5KpcTg\/WDbKF5zrs5I\/AAAAAAAAhzc\/nPebnD_PMhI0RZCY1Lv9l2iN4c98IFdnwCLcB\/s1600\/Three%2BSimple%2BNon-Sugary%2BFestive%2BDrinks%2BYou%2BCan%2BMake%2BAt%2BHome%2B%2528That%2BHave%2BBeauty%2BBenefits%2BToo%2521%2529%2B%2B2.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWARMING SOY EGGNOG\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EDid you know that the 'isoflavones' in soy can help protect collagen in the skin, while studies have even shown it can help defend against the formation of wrinkles?

I do find it fascinating that our music tastes change so rapidly, and the mainstream charts are never filled with the same style from one year to the next, but when it comes to holiday music we turn to the same tunes that have been making us smile for decades. Maybe it's the nostalgia associated with a certain song, the emotions that come to the surface when popping on the CD that's only played once a year, or the fact that festive music transcends generations, tastes and musical styles - we all have our all-time favourites that we turn to time and time again.

Whether I got them or not, it was about dreaming and wishing for that special something - and hoping I'd been good enough for Santa to find the budget. Writing a Christmas list was actively encouraged in my household, not only from a logistical point of view, but because it offered a moment of festive joy where we could all sit around the table with the music on wishing for more goodies than could physically fit through the front door. When you're a kid there's not much room for error (as long as it involved Barbie or dinosaurs I was a happy chappy,) but as we get older and have more disposable income to buy the things we want when we want them, the gift giving process is somewhat trickier. Those inevitable questions start from mid-November when everyone wants to know if there's something you particularly fancy; but do you deflect back with a simple suggestion, shrug your shoulders and say 'I don't really need anything' or do you get all 'Rachel from Friends' and offer up a list of appropriate gifts listed in order of price bracket?\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-QF9gIoUvWoA\/WDQw5yIElYI\/AAAAAAAAhyE\/9QtXUBgyVbEoToSytRPfElOSrOw8lbipACLcB\/s1600\/Letters%2BTo%2BSanta%2BWhy%2BChristmas%2BWish%2BLists%2BAre%2BAlways%2BA%2BGreat%2BIdea%252C%2BNo%2BMatter%2BYour%2BAge.%2B%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EAlthough you may think Christmas lists are only for those aged 12 and under, there's definite positives for embracing the task no mater your age. Push aside those feelings of greed if you dare to ask for something you'd genuinely get use out of, or those ideas that the best gifts are bought by those that should know you best (my mum bought me pink things for years until I finally told her I hated the colour,) because at the end of the day everyone wants to give a gift that will be cherished.

Us Brits often struggle to be as open and emotional as we would like, but there's no getting away with it at Christmas time; even the most stony-faced are forced to break a smile, receive a hug and dance to Slade at the office party. Whether you're searching for the perfect gift for a partner, family member or friend, one of the most popular presents at this time of year is undoubtedly a bottle of fragrance. It's  the little extravagance we often can't justify buying ourselves, but a  beautiful bottle and daily moment of luxury is a welcome gift amidst  the usual socks and selection boxes; every time they dab the scent onto  their neck they'll think of the person that presented it to them,  meaning it provides a lasting memory and connection that can be  cherished. That all may sound well and good, but realistically stepping into your local perfume outlet can often feel us with dread - there's so much pressure to get it right, because you certainly don't want them returning it come Boxing Day in favour of the same one they've been wearing for years.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-UNfu9aTISg8\/WDL2TunNchI\/AAAAAAAAhxY\/6eBWfp-TaR48MXtOqb7DahZjfFJbrG4_ACLcB\/s1600\/Want%2BTo%2BBuy%2BYour%2BLoved%2BOne%2BA%2BFragrance%2BThis%2BHoliday%2BSeason%2BHere%25E2%2580%2599s%2BWhat%2BYou%2BNeed%2BTo%2BAsk%2BThem%2521%2B2.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003ECounter staff can always offer up assistance and are trained to ask you the right questions to make that decision easier, but you're the only person that can make that final choice.

Whether it's that first mince pie, the red cups from your favourite coffee shop, finally being able to pop on your bobble hat or simply stocking up on wrapping paper like it's going out of fashion. All the little nuisances that make up our individual holiday season are what makes it special - and for me it's popping on the Christmas music and sipping on a nice cup of tea. In recent years it's become clear that Mr Bublé could be renamed Mr Christmas, thanks to the almost universal connection we make between his voice and the opening of yet another advent calendar door; Michael Bublé is the king of the crooners and his holiday album continues to be a best seller year after year. (While recently clearing out my Great Aunts flat she actually had three copies of the same CD, presumably playing in every room of her apartment from December 1st!) Although it's not possible to mail-order yourself a piece of Bublé, this Christmas you can ask Santa for a bottle of his debut fine fragrance - which is almost as good as opening the real thing on Christmas morning.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-8csfzvleG20\/WDLTXnGqVEI\/AAAAAAAAhwc\/A_NF4XH4vP4I0iCZ6tUOxQM6fM9j2WOawCLcB\/s1600\/michael%2Bbuble%2Bby%2Binvitation%252C%2Bchristmas%2Bgift%252C%2Bperfumes%252C%2Bperfume%252C%2Bfragrances%252C%2Bfragrance%252C%2Bperfume%2Bgift%2Bset%252C%2B%2Bwomen%252C%2Bfragrance%252C%2Beau%2Bde%2Bparfum%252C%2Bdiscount%2Bperfumes%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EMichael has been heavily involved in developing a beautiful elegant  scent that personifies his own timeless appeal. 'By Invitation' is  described as a 'crisp floral oriental', but the warming base notes  ensure it's a sensual and timeless addition to any fragrance portfolio.  Starting with light and sparkling top notes of red fruits and bergamot,  the scent then develops its heart notes of lily of the valley, elegant  rose, a wild jasmine and the spicy inflexions of peony; By Invitation  then wraps you in a warm base of sandalwood-musks, blended with an  addictive vanilla praline, leaving behind a lingering addictively warm  scent. This is not like any other 'celebrity' fragrance you will have experienced, because the ingredients and composition are more akin to a premium perfume house than an affordable spritz; although there's a lot of snobbery around scent, every single one of the thirty or forty people I've known to have smelt this have been pleasantly surprised and instantly fallen for 'By Invitation'. That's a testament you can't argue with.

Whether it was a bullet of Heather Shimmer lipstick, a dusting of Collection 2000 powder or a slick of gloopy mascara I'd claimed from my mum's stash, I always loved the ritualistic nature of applying my makeup. There's something quite cathartic about creating a persona or new representation of yourself with just a few simple tools; the beauty of great makeup is that you can be whoever you want to be, no matter what you're actually feeling like beneath the surface. How many times are we told that a touch of lipstick has the transformative power of Clark Kent's glasses, or that all we need to disguise that heavy night is a touch of creamy concealer? Having a portfolio of tools at your disposal doesn't make you any more or less of a woman, nor is it 'false advertising' as so many seem to accuse; I can guarantee you that 99.9% of women apply makeup to feel good about themselves - and they couldn't give a toss about Tom, Dick or Harry's opinion. Anyway, I digress. My point here is that it's absolutely ok to be passionate about makeup or beauty in whichever form you choose to digest it, but it's also absolutely ok to have those days where you say to yourself in the mirror: \"I just can't be bothered.\" \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-W-ne21uu_Lw\/WC8sdzLhllI\/AAAAAAAAhvk\/wZgcaW32F60yxTJbiJpXH9ZApY_WVBv-ACLcB\/s1600\/Why%2BI%2BGive%2BMy%2BFace%2BThe%2BDay%2BOff%2BThe%2BImportance%2BOf%2BMakeup-Free%2BMoments%2B.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EFor me, those days are mostly when I'm working from home and have a sh*t-tonne of work to get through, so any unnecessary tasks that take up any valuable time are ignored. If nobody is going to see me, then why waste a good fifteen minutes of my morning applying product that ends up being a waste of effort, time and money? It's the perfect excuse to lather on a great skin oil or super-hydrating moisturiser, chuck my hair back in a ponytail and get on with my day. Outside of that, Sundays are always my low-key makeup day; if I manage to put on anything at all, it's a paired-back version of my usual look with just a dash of lipgloss and mascara. It seems a bit ridiculous to spend so much time chiseling my cheekbones when I'm wandering to Starbucks or stocking up at ASDA - and a super polished look really doesn't feel necessary when I'm showcasing my usual jeans and jumper combo.\u0026nbsp;\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWith social media now making us accessible 24\/7, it's understandable that we're increasingly under pressure to always 'be on'. If there's even the slightest chance we'll be instagramming, tweeting or snapchatting, it's hard to embrace our natural beauty that lies beneath a tonne of makeup and a hair 'do that involved thirty minutes slaving away with a hot pair of tongs. Maybe it's an age thing, but I don't want to have to prep and preen myself every single day when there are far more important things to be getting on with - whether that's housework, admin tasks or simply a date with Netflix. Here are some of the reasons I'm increasingly embracing my naked face wholeheartedly, and encourage you to consider doing the same.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ETAKE SOME TIME BACK\u003Cbr \/\u003EIt's estimated that we spend over 400 days during our average lifetimes applying makeup. For most that's a fifteen to sixty minute morning ritual that could actually be put to better use once in a while. If you opted for a 'makeup free' day once a week, think of the other stuff you could get done - from a quick yoga session, to finally cleaning your makeup brushes or simply doing the washing up.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELET YOUR SKIN BREATHE\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlthough makeup is becoming increasingly lightweight and non-comedogenic (designed to not block pores,) on the whole adding layer upon layer of product could have a detremental impact on skin. If you're prone to breakouts, dryness or irritation then your makeup could be exacerbating the problem; giving your skin a chance to naturally re-balance can only ever be a good thing. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELOVE YOUR IMPERFECTIONS\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe problem with applying our 'war paint' on a daily basis is that we can develop a negative relationship with our imperfections and start to perceive them as quirks that 'need correcting.' Whether that's dark circles, blemishes, freckles or a larger nose than you would have chosen for yourself, it's important to love yourself for who you are and have a positive relationship with your face. We shouldn't be afraid to look in the mirror makeup free, nor should we worry about loved ones seeing us without our face on; the more you embrace it, the more positive relationship you'll have with yourself.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EDOUBLE UP ON SKINCARE\u003Cbr \/\u003EApplying nine layers of skincare underneath your makeup isn't always realistic, so skipping your foundation allows you to increase your usual skincare routine and leave the products to get to work. Oils and heavier creams are great for 'no makeup' days, as they'll leave your complexion looking radiant and glowing while giving your skin what it needs.

Nah, who am I kidding? I love it so much I'd happily live in a Winter Wonderland 365 days of the year - that's both the upside and downside of being a Christmas Eve baby, being forever entwined with a holiday that's all about the chocolate, candles and champagne. As we approach the festive season there are always Christmas dinners and celebrations galore, but it all kicked off for me with a beautiful display and tonnes of French pampering treats courtesy of L'Occitane - undoubtedly one of my favourite brands ever. This year there are even more beautiful gift sets and holiday treats than ever, all offering great savings and wrapped up in delectable packaging so you don't even have to battle with the sellotape.

Similarly your morning teeth clean is essential to keep bacteria and bad breath at bay, but it can also have a significant impact on the way we feel about what we see in the mirror - and the beauty choices we make. It's well known that certain shades of lipstick can have a negative impact on the brightness of our teeth (with orange-reds, corals and browns being the worst offenders,) while others can make our smiles appear fresher (blue undertones and bright pinks help to trick the eye into thinking teeth are whiter.) But what if you could throw all that out of the window and wear whatever shade took your fancy, without worrying whether or not your teeth can pull it off? Thankfully polished white teeth are no longer seen as something that's purely the concern of your dentist, as sparkling results can be achieved at home with the use of a great toothbrush and regime.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-wQi9s4Y4gVk\/WC149L4zadI\/AAAAAAAAhsA\/xoIuPTn6PL0quvLbtq75WoXZVc2FVBcqQCLcB\/s1600\/Wear%2BAny%2BLipstick%2BShade%2BWith%2BConfidence%2BThanks%2BTo%2BThe%2BBest%2BToothbrush%2BI%2527ve%2BEver%2BUsed%2B3.jpg\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EI've been using the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean for the best part of three years and it's hands-down the best toothbrush I've ever used.

The super slick handle and digital controls make it the ultimate tool to show off in your bathroom, while the glass charging unit and portable USB-chargeable carry case ensure this feels like the future of dentistry. What's super exciting as we step towards Christmas, is that Philips have launched a super on-trend rose gold version that's set to be a huge hit with bloggers, instagram lovers and home-ware obsessives alike. The stylish toothbrush features a stunning pearlised finish with rose  gold detailing, alongside a rose gold glass charger and matching carry case - making it a beautiful addition to any bathroom. As we all become a little more home conscious and spend our weekends in Habitat and Dunelm, it makes sense to change up one of the things that's always on display and lift our beauty regime in the process.\u0026nbsp; \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/philips.to\/LBQDiamondClean\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EPhilips Sonicare DiamondClean\u003C\/a\u003E isn't cheap, but if you're always on the look out for more effective ways to clean your teeth, want to boost your confidence or simply love a bit of tech, then it's a worthy investment and one that will pay off for years to come.

Although I'm a bit over traditional gift guides, this year there's so much great stuff to share with you that we're gonna have a lot of old fun in the run up to the Big Day - starting with our favourite bath bomb destination, Lush. I would always be delighted to find a Lush box under the tree come December 25th, but way before the very first advent calendar door was opened I'd be down at my local store stocking up on bottles of Snow Fairy and Santa shaped bath treats. Those richly scented stores have become somewhat of a destination over the holiday period, thanks to the pure fun they inject while keeping it all affordable. Everyone can justify treating themselves to a bottle of festive shower gel, or stockpiling bubble bars as last minute stocking fillers; this year Lush have pulled out all the stops (or the crackers, sorry...) to create a collection of goodies you're going to want to get your hands on one way or another. Although there are too many individual things to mention, I've pulled together an edit of my personal faves and things I know you're wishing your Secret Santa discovers on a last minute dash down the high street. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-U-tq_N8ss_Y\/WCyDGW67k3I\/AAAAAAAAhrc\/wHtq6pzKKTY_8Q371s9divoxPErFLeUqQCLcB\/s1600\/It%2527s%2BNot%2BChristmas%2BWithout%2BSnow%2BFairy%2BFestive%2BOfferings%2BFrom%2BLush%2BThat%2BYour%2BSweet%2BTooth%2BWill%2BLove%2B9.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ETHE BATH BOMBS \u0026amp; BUBBLE BARS\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EChristmas can get stressful, that's for sure, so we all need a time out with a bath bomb or two.

Although we can easily conceal grey hairs or dress to suit our body shape, it’s hard to detract from years of skincare neglect if your complexion has been left to its own devices. From around the age of 25 our bodies start to show the first signs of ageing, so it’s even more essential to provide the helping hand it needs to look and feel its best. Although skincare can be intimidating (show me a single woman that doesn’t stand in the skincare aisles of Boots looking a bit baffled,) with a few easy pointers and only a handful of steps, you can build a regime that meets your needs without taking any more time away from your slumber. French and Korean women may have in excess of ten steps in their routine, but it’s not necessary to adopt such a complex and time consuming daily pattern in order to boost your skin. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/yesto.co.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EYes To\u003C\/a\u003E are a brand that have always encouraged women to build a comprehensive skincare routine, introducing 95% natural or more formulas into a daily regime without compromising on efficacy.

Makeup and grime left on the surface of skin (either overnight or in the morning) can block pores, cause irritation and even accelerate the signs of ageing; if you're only reaching for a face wipe or opting for a foaming cleanser you've been using since your teens, then you need to wise up. Get yourself a cleansing oil, balm or cream for the evening, as well as a non-foaming cleanser for the morning; these are non-stripping but will help to effectively remove any build-up of dead skin cells and grime, leaving you with a squeaky clean surface from which to work. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESTEP 2: THE EYES HAVE IT\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EMy absolute must-have for anyone looking in the mirror and seeing those fine lines starting to appear around the eyes, is a targeted eye treatment. Applying an amount only equal to a grain of rice on both eyes and massaging outwards to aid drainage will leave eyes looking fresher, brighter and less puffy; it's a step that many skip, but the area of the face that's most prone to dullness and ageing. Always apply your eye cream before any serum or moisturiser, so you avoid overloading the area with product and actually making it look even more puffy - as well as only applying around the crease of your eye and no closer to the lower lid. \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.boots.com\/en\/Yes-to-Blueberries-Eye-Firming-Treatment-15ml-for-Fine-Lines-and-Wrinkles_1457219\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EYes To Blueberries Eye Firming Treatment\u003C\/a\u003E (£14.99) is a quickly-absorbed and effective formula that helps to ease puffiness and tackle fine lines; it blends paracress flower, anti-oxidant rich blueberries and skin-softening beeswax to leave skin looking and feeling more awake. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESTEP 3: EMBRACE THE SERUM\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EIf there's one product that confuses women more than most, then it's a serum. This isn't an alternative to moisturiser, but in fact an addition that will really help to tackle your individual woes and leave your skin looking and feeling more healthy. A serum is effectively a concentrated formula packed full of hardworking ingredients that tackle everything from dryness and dullness, to the first signs of ageing and oily complexions. The ingredients within will help to make the biggest change over time, but make sure you look to invest in a product that really claims to target your issues - rather than just opting for the most expensive or complex. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ESTEP 4: MOISTURISE, MOISTURISE\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EOnce you've applied your serum it's time to get hydrated.

It's long been said that our skin 'regenerates' as we sleep, mainly because it's not focusing on defending itself from free radicals and irritants that we're exposed to as part and parcel of daily life, so investing in a product that will provide a nighttime boost is a must.

It's overdone and under appreciated. I love it when brands look to rather unexpected places for influence, especially when that influence has a historical significance but is also still relatively close in time to our own experiences. Not one to usually talk about a launch four months before you can actually get your hands on it, there's a collection coming from Jo Malone London in 2017 that I couldn't wait to share with you; it's beautiful in both its construction and the story behind the fragrance, meaning it's well worth pulling up a chair and immersing yourself in a little history.

The best known members included Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Lytton Strachey, all whom were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts. Their works and outlook deeply influenced the modern attitudes towards literature, aesthetics, feminism and sexuality; at the time they were undoubtedly seen as rather scandalous, but upon reflection they were simply ahead of their time. Not only did they meet in London, but their complex relationships (which in today’s society we’d undoubtedly call 'open' and worthy of an episode of Jeremy Kyle) took them to country retreats - including that of Charleston Farmhouse in Sussex.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EJo Malone London’s newest collection celebrates this important cultural collective with a collection of five scents that each embody the spirit of the set and the location that they spent so much time enjoying. Each one of the five fragrances translates the emotion of a room or destination within Charleston Farmhouse beautifully, creating scents that work beautifully alone - but leave an even more evocative lingering scent when layered to establish something even more delicious. The promotional images were shot at the same location that inspired the range, while each individually has a story to tell.

Although I'm not normally a floral person at all, the Garden Lillies is light and fresh enough to work beautifully as a base scent, while the earthy undertone blends seamlessly with something a bit more masculine. The last few launches from Jo Malone have left me somewhat underwhelmed (they smelt a bit too like home scents to spike my interest,) this collection restores my faith and leaves me counting down the days until it hits stores. Although the story behind the scents (and the bottles) will either be interesting or as boring as a GCSE art lesson, the fragrances within are really quite something.

Whether it represents an pivotal moment, reminds you of a loved one, is the materialisation of an achievement or is simply something you fell in love with, it's always so much more than a piece of metal. I've always adored jewellery and have many pieces that I've accumulated over the years that continue to offer me joy - even if they're no longer my style. My mother worked in a jewelers when I was a child, so she'd always come home with new sparkly pieces or beautiful ornate treasures that she'd buy when payday came around; I guess that's where I picked up my love and passion for rings, necklaces, earrings and bracelets - because to me it was the epitome of hard work or the once yearly birthday treat I looked forward to every time. Although I dabbled in high street jewellery during my 20's, in the last few years I've become far more interested in investing in pieces I know will last - and more importantly, won't turn my hands green on a humid summer's day. There's something incredibly special about wearing beautiful delicate pieces that have a story, or represent something to you individually; that's something a Topshop statement ring just can't compete with! \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-0sqozQPl-zk\/WCmu8xVDW5I\/AAAAAAAAhn8\/pecaly3mkmYY0B0nGU7Rbb99DdM51nTjwCLcB\/s1600\/Telling%2BTime%2BIn%2BThe%2BMost%2BBeautiful%2BFashion%2BBrunch%2BWith%2BOlivia%2BBurton%2B%2526%2BThe%2BNew%2BJewellery%2BCollection%2B%2B111.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003EOne of the brands that I discovered fairly recently (actually via Instagram) is Olivia Burton. I instantly fell for the timeless, yet modern designs that put a twist on something that could often be seen as a bit functional. Watches serve a purpose, but they don't have to be a thoughtless add on - they can absolutely be an extension of an outfit and a statement piece that says more about you than the shoes on your feet. Unlike the majority of my friends, I've had a watch for every occasion and look for some time (whether that's a chunky rose gold number, stylish silver face or waterproof Swatch) and added to this collection with a beautiful \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ga2mgv\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EAutumn piece\u003C\/a\u003E that I couldn't stop dreaming about. The dark green strap, black face and rose gold detailing may sound horrendous, but it really brings the timepiece to life and creates something that works with almost every item in my Winter wardrobe effortlessly.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis gorgeous wrist watch is one of the key pieces from the Autumn Olivia Burton collection, but there's so much more than this singular item to tickle your fancy - including a brand new collection of jewellery in silver, gold and rose gold hardware that I discovered over brunch in my new favourite venue, \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/dallowayterrace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EDalloway Terrace\u003C\/a\u003E. If tasty breakfast treats, endless pots of coffee and delicious pastries weren't enough, then the debut jewellery line definitely left our mouths watering. Olivia Burton's iconic bee (seen on many of the watch faces) has been given a new lease of life in ring, bracelet, earring and necklace form that perfectly complements her classic watch designs. Each item within the capsule jewellery collection has been designed to work alongside the timepieces, adding depth of interest without distracting from the statement piece.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhether you choose to layer up, invest in a singular piece or dabble in the brand as a whole, there's certainly something you're going to love. My personal favourites include the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.oliviaburton.com\/jewellery-c122\/moulded-bee-c108\/moulded-bee-open-end-bangle-rose-gold-p672\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Erose gold bee bangle\u003C\/a\u003E, alongside the \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.oliviaburton.com\/jewellery-c122\/moulded-bee-c108\/moulded-bee-disc-necklace-gold-p677\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ebee necklace\u003C\/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.oliviaburton.com\/jewellery-c122\/engravables-c110\/engravables-disc-chain-bracelet-silver-p683\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Esimple silver bracelet\u003C\/a\u003E that works beautifully with the grey of my new \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.oliviaburton.com\/personalised-c35\/big-dial-grey-rose-gold-personalised-p571\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Epersonalised watch\u003C\/a\u003E. (That's right, you can get up to six letters embossed on the strap! Such a great Christmas gift.) What I love about Olivia Burton as a brand is that they're feminine without being girlie, on-trend without being ridiculously high fashion, and affordably priced without compromising on quality. Their watches have been designed to offer pleasure, without a prohibitive costs which means you can only ever afford one; with the jewellery collection starting at £35.00 and the watches at £80.00, they prove you don't have to spend a fortune to get something you'll treasure.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EDo you have a favourite piece from the photos below?

Up until a few years ago I barely had an eyeshadow brush at my disposal, preferring to use the warmth and durability of my own fingers to apply everything from foundation to eyeshadow and even a touch of blusher. Oh how things have changed. I use roughly eight brushes every time I apply my makeup, creating a much more uniform and long-lasting result that's really upped my game; even if I tried to revert back to old habits I simply couldn't bring myself to do so (proven by the painful times I've forgotten even one essential tool on holiday.) If you've been following my \u003Ca href=\"http:\/\/www.londonbeautyqueen.com\/search\/label\/QVS\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Eseries with QVS Beauty\u003C\/a\u003E, you'll be pretty wised up on beauty tools and the best ways to use them already, but we could all do with a little extra knowledge or integrating a new trick into our routine right?

For a lighter or dewier finish, use your sponges or blending tools wet. Running them under a warm tap and blotting away excess water before dipping them in foundation will help it to set lighter and provide a more radiant finish.\u0026nbsp; \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E2. To reduce the amount of liquid product your using (and wasting,) it's always best to opt for synthetic brushes. The bristles won't absorb your foundation or concealer, giving you not only a cleaner finish but ensuring each bottle lasts for even longer. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E3. If you tend to create a bit of a mess when attempting a smokey eye, then a clean fluffy brush can be used to dust off excess eyeshadow; it can also be used to buff away over zealous bronzer application and generally help to blend together any obvious lines. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E4. Don't be bogged down by the brush's description. Most makeup brushes can be used for multiple techniques, so don't always just use them for their intended purpose - I've been known to adopt a lip brush as an eyeshadow buffer, as well as a bronzer brush for applying foundation.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E5. The skill of great makeup application is all in the blending. Fluffy brushes can be used to blend together eyeshadow colours and create every look imaginable - but when you think you're done, you're not. Blend a little more and see how much better it looks.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E6. Cleaning your tools is the secret to success - you can't use a dodgy, dirty and old paintbrush to decorate a wall. Get rid of makeup build up weekly by cleansing in brush or baby shampoo until the water runs clear; lay them flat on kitchen roll so they dry effectively and quickly. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E7. When cleaning your tools, be careful not to damage them with excessive pressure; also avoid soaking them in brush cleaner as it can dissolve the glue that holds the bristles together.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E8. Avoid using one brush with multiple colours, as you won't achieve the desired colour result. Always use a separate brushes for different shades of eyeshadow (or for\u0026nbsp;bronzing\/highlighting) even if you have five of the same tool.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E9. You don't have to spend a fortune on makeup brushes to get a tool that  offers great quality. Look for a symmetrical brush head that doesn't  have any loose bristles, as well as a ferrule (the metal bit) that's  secure; this will ensure your brush stays effective in the long-term.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E10. As soon as your makeup brushes start to look or feel tatty, they need replacing. Although good quality brushes can last for years if they're well looked after, no brush will work effectively indefinitely. Have a good sort through every six months and throw away any brushes that have seen better days. (Need some new ones?

When I struggle to know what month (let alone what day) it is, then it's time for time out and a little escape out of the city and into the countryside. I'm lucky enough to live in leafy Buckinghamshire so it's easier for me than most to see some greenery and relax along by the river on a Sunday afternoon, but even so a good road trip is often what's required to refresh the body and mind. Last weekend we took an afternoon off to drive through country lanes into the middle of nowhere to discover Fishmore Hall and their brand new 'rural spa' that's located deep in the Shropshire hills and overlooks some of the most stunning scenery; if you need a day or two away from anything and anywhere, then this is certainly the destination for you. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-d8Mu8eS2xDE\/WCRNQfWp7wI\/AAAAAAAAhis\/ix3UjTyo_6EYp92l22MXeRMXELmnipSzACLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B25.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003EA beautifully restored Georgian house, Fishmore Hall boasts fifteen spacious bedrooms and a restaurant that serves up some of the most delicious food I've ever tasted. We enjoyed a delicious five course meal that included scallops, duck and  the most delicious salted caramel desert (I'm still dreaming of it,)  which are all created using local produce and expertise. The house is spacious, quiet, charming and relaxing, while offering plenty of space to take time out with a book and a cup of tea. Because there are only a few bedrooms, it doesn't ever feel busy or bustling - continuing the relaxing and almost remote feeling you get from the surroundings.

Fishmore Hall has plenty of little nooks, crannies and places to sit and take in the surroundings that look even more appealing with the backdrop of the Autumn landscape. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-eYpJ9ufWQRo\/WCRLmM3JbcI\/AAAAAAAAhiU\/r5vDFURqbSUxkNOyBtJvRyPbjAt5GIG1QCEw\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B21.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-DBe_hJcmMS0\/WCRLUlIg-CI\/AAAAAAAAhiI\/wbwBm0bGHj4DMlUEEEOyftSK2b3Np90OQCLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B7.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-JRGFvyzic1U\/WCRJleahiLI\/AAAAAAAAhhc\/-p2OxrvbmnMeWYEVL19nswIcbfjvORaqQCEw\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B10.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-l6H4KpJ0ms0\/WCRLgVJP_VI\/AAAAAAAAhiQ\/bO6OesP1-UI82Irqtb_7_O0X_HxGHI_9QCLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B9.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003EThe 'Shell Spa' itself has only just opened, so it feels very fresh and new.

With relaxation areas both inside and outside, you can enjoy afternoon tea or lunch without having to change out of your robe too. The highlight for me though was definitely the hot tub and hammock, both of which provided far too much enjoyment than they probably should have done! Sitting in a giant bath tub and overlooking absolutely nothing is incredibly relaxing and really did help to wash away the cobwebs from my mind; I've not felt so at ease for a long time, nor have I not felt the need to pick up my phone and document every detail - I just wanted to breathe it in. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-sl7IS_7zg1A\/WCRJpCqwoKI\/AAAAAAAAhhg\/7PsRa2Vy8tUgDilWBDuZMGbpKXiXH2QHgCLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B12.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-pz0yG77-RJw\/WCRJtad0L_I\/AAAAAAAAhhk\/zE_ZXPdm8tEMmBFUqoqpB5s7CUf7shD0gCLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B14.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-kkSQgtmpY_M\/WCRK2F23LsI\/AAAAAAAAhho\/NknvvI8nZMsF4_242a_4VeLFXN5uOCEzgCLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B15.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-KANf0wtWW8A\/WCROLh2IGJI\/AAAAAAAAhiw\/Nsb2P5GZl34O5qrYEJ7qfWrZNPJh7Cc_ACLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B13.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-2mYUAxMlZH4\/WCRK_l9n9fI\/AAAAAAAAhhw\/_6o9_JNJOsEucqJthHjllX1k2Tktckk6wCLcB\/s1600\/Escape%2BTo%2BNowhere%2B24hrs%2BIn%2BThe%2BCountry%2BAt%2BFishmore%2BHall%2Belemis%2Bshell%2Bspa%2Beco%2B17.png\" \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhile in the spa I also enjoyed a full body massage and treatment to help relax me even further.

Although the spa is still in the very early stages (there were plants waiting to be painted, fences waiting to be put up, no hairdryers or body wash in the shower!) it's a truly unique experience and definitely a destination that I can see being incredibly popular in the years to come.

Whether you love it or hate it, the festive season will soon be upon us so it's time to start considering what's going to make the Christmas list and which covetable pieces we'll be picking up for loved ones. Fortunately for us, the beauty brands have been busy creating their annual limited edition collections and injecting a touch of sparkle into an otherwise standard smokey palette - but many of them leave the glitz at the door and forget what this party season is all about. When it comes to curating gift guides and present recommendations, I can often struggle to find truly creative or lustworthy gifts because many brands just pop their regular products in a cardboard box and call it a gift. Others re-release the same 'limited edition' glittery eyeshadows with a slightly different packaging design and label them 'must haves'. \u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cimg border=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-SV9uIaenLso\/WCIbaUlxA-I\/AAAAAAAAhfc\/dD5Zz3jBB2knAOGlLxajE6nOF0Wz0vFWACLcB\/s1600\/A%2BWord%2BAbout%2BWhat%2BReally%2BMakes%2BA%2BChristmas%2BCollection%2BSpecial%2B%2528And%2BBobbi%2BBrown%2527s%2BVery%2BBeautiful%2BOffering%2529%2B2016%2B1.png\" \/\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Ca name='more'\u003E\u003C\/a\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003ELike with every area of beauty, consumers are becoming increasingly  demanding and what more from their festive gifts - be that value, unique  products that they can't get anywhere else, beautiful packaging or  covetable treats that make us feel special. A festive gift has to have  that x-factor, the wow factor and the emotional connection that makes us  think 'need'; if you don't capture that then it's just another face  cream or lipstick sitting at the bottom of a stocking. So many of the  things that have already landed on my desk leave me with a rather bland  taste in my mouth, because unless you genuinely love that product  already (and ask for a year's supply) it's not all that exciting.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EHowever, one brand that seems to get Christmas right every year is undoubtedly Bobbi Brown. Some of their collections throughout the other seasons leave me somewhat underwhelmed, but every time December creeps up I know something special is around the corner. This year is no different, as the 'Wine \u0026amp; Chocolate' collection delivers a touch of retro elegance, wearable shades and packaging that's almost too lustworthy to deal with; now *this* is what I'm talking about! I adore the leatherette texture and bright golden packages, as well as the deep chocolate and red wine tones that aren't too on-trend or 'out there' not to transition you into winter and out the other side with ease. If bold lips, statement nails or smokey eyes aren't your thing, then don't fear - because there's a couple of beautiful blushes and highlighting squares that will add a touch of shimmer and colour to cheeks to perk them right up on a cold and blustery day.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThis collection encompasses what limited editions are supposed to be about: something a little special, something a little different and something that makes you think 'need!' We all love a bit of shimmer and sparkle, but if you can only wear it in the days surrounding Christmas and New Year then it's a slightly wasted investment; the colour offering within this is universal in terms of age, interest in beauty and look to ensure you can use every last drop. Additionally there are also some of their almost cult classic palettes that include mini mascaras and highlighters alongside blushers and eyeshadows, giving you a travel friendly way to keep your makeup looking fresh. If Bobbi Brown makeup were a snuggly blanket, I'd wrap myself in it and never let go. As the lights turn on and the trees go up, if there's one collection you check out when doing your Christmas shopping make it this.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWhat makes a Christmas collection special for you?\u0026nbsp;
