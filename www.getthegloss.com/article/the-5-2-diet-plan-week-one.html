	<p class="intro">How do you do the 5:2 diet? In a six week series, nutritional therapist Vicki Edgson brings you the ultimate guide</p>
<p>It's been a while since a diet craze came along that wasn't slaughtered by the experts and deemed a Very Bad Idea, but ever since the concept of the <a href="../video/vicki-edgson-s-5-2-diet-plan.html">5:2 diet</a> (that's the 'five to two' diet) came along a quiet buzz has swept calorie counters everywhere.</p>
<p>It all started when <a href="https://www.getthegloss.com/article/fast-track-to-weight-loss-the-5-2-diet">Dr Michael Mosley</a> attracted our attention with BBC's <em>Horizon</em> programme <em>Eat, Fast, Live Longer</em>, which saw him adopt a new way of fasting to lose a stone in five weeks. Curious yet?<br><br>The diet involves five days 'on' and two days 'off'; that is, five days of eating normally (keep it healthy, mind) and two days of cutting calorie intake to around 500 calories each. It's fasting, but in a more manageable way than we've ever seen before. <br><br>But how to do the 5:2 diet, you ask? For the next six weeks health and nutrition expert <a href="http://www.vickiedgson.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vicki Edgson</a> will be bringing you a weekly free diet plan of what to eat and when - with plenty of great tips and food inspiration along the way. In fact, she makes it sound all pretty easy, not to mention tasty…</p>

		<p>Hi ,New to 5:2 ,need to lose 2stone ...am I right in thing that its best to do FD split rather than together and how long do you fast between tea and next meal please ...I think I would rather miss breakfast and have a piece of fruit for lunch and have most of my calories in evening meal ...any tips are welcome ....I am limited to exercise as I have MS which restricts my mobility x</p>

		<p>I started the 5:2 on 19/5/14 and have lost 7lbs in 1 month. My target is another 8lbs. A great information source is the 5:2 original book. Get the Gloss has great updates, I check them out for inspiration and ideas. I fast on Tuesdays/Thursdays and exercise on those days plus Fridays. My favourite FD breakfast is banana &amp; strawberry smoothie with greek yogurt from the 5:2 recipes. Make sure you stay hydrated with plenty of water/herbal teas etc. For dinner I have tried an abundance of different proteins: tuna, prawns, feta or chicken with loads of salad. I feel refreshed &amp; healthy after my FDs and am excited to see further losses!</p>

		<p>Having spoken to two (also male) friends last week who have lost one and two stones respectively, I've decided finally to grasp the nettle and have a go at the 5:2. Week 1 starts today and I weigh precisely 14 st. Have also taken the other measurements suggested on various sites. Target is to get to 12st 7 lbs by Christmas. Wish me luck! Cantoris. P.S. Just off for my banana breakfast.</p>

		<p>Hi, just found this forum, I have been following this diet for about 6 weeks now and have lost quite a bit of weight, I do exercise everyday.<br>
I tend to only eat a meal in the evening on my fast days and maybe some fruit at lunchtime, I do drink plenty of water and fruit or herbal teas as well.<br>
I find if I don't eat I don't feel hungry, so this works for me also I rarely eat breakfast so don't think about food until at least lunchtime. <br>
I sometimes find it difficult to eat enough calories on eating days and so I am concentrating on eating more. <br>
How do people with families manage on fast days, I usually cook a low calories meal and give my husband and daughter extra, but I find it difficult sometimes to divide portions acurately.</p>

		<p>Hi...am new to this site and would like to share my experiences. I am a 47 year old male, who exercises moderately. At the start of the year (Jan 2013), I weighed 80kgs. I then started, early Feb, to follow a similar self-set diet to that of the 5:2. I changed my diet to 2 days of 600 calories, 3 days of 1200 calories, and 2 days eat what I want. I have never dieted before and did not follow anyone's advice - just tried calorie watching according to what I thought was best. I now weigh 67 kgs....so it is working for me. I want to get down to 64kgs but the last 3 seem the hardest to shift. I am going to try walking 10 000 steps a day to see if that helps.</p>

		<p>Tracey young - I was very interested to view yr comments. I too have no thyroid and find it extremely difficult to lose weight. I have read dr Mosley's book and done quite a lot of research. Did u have to check with yr doc b4 starting this. I want to view it as a change of lifestyle rather than a diet. I tend to be a plain eater, soups, scrambled eggs, beans on toast etc. any tips?  Oh yes any weight loss would b fantastic!!!</p>

		<p>I have just found this site and am thinking about giving it a go. I lost 2.5 stone at Slimming World a year ago but its creeping back on. I am thinking about combining the fasting with slimming world diet the rest of the time. I tend not to eat much on a Saturday so if I fast from Friday after tea, say 7pm, then can I have a normal meal on Saturday evening. Then same again on Tuesday. Is it worth buying the book.</p>

		<p>Hi Lynne and sally, I have lost a little weight on this eating style which is good; think calories doesnt matter how you make up your 500-600 cals I decide my fast days as to how i feel in the morning of that day. don't set yourself up for failing.</p>

		<p>Hi, I have just found out about this diet, so I have a few questions: how long is it safe to follow the diet? I'm vegetarian, would this be a problem? Do you have to stick to calorie counting on the non-fast days? Any help you can give would be gratefully received.</p>

		<p>Hello everybody, I googled the 5:2 diet and ended up here so I hope you don't mind me joining in the conversation. I have absolutely no idea how to set about this diet, let alone what foods add up to 500 calories. Can you pick and choose the 500 cal days, or do you have to do the same days each week?</p>

Coffee Mocha: Teaspoon of low cal hot choc ( 35 cals) topped up with proper coffee and hot water. Not need for milk or sugar!</p>

		<p>Doing ok: despite thyroid have lost 2 ibs! Even stuffed up my fast last mnute twice but the effort was there. Had a day of yesterday with friends and ate picnic lunch and an indian take away last night so fasting today. Didnt honestly think I wolud have lost anything but a walking regularly as usual so it all adds up on a fast day if you do go over at the last minute!</p>

		<p>James ; Days arent consecutive just pick two days in the week that fit in with your shedule.<br>
Laveen: Weight loss depends on what you eat after the fast day I suspect and where you are in your cycle. I know my weight can go up and down daily, even hourly never mind weekly. A glass of water weighs a pound! I try to stay off bread on a fast day as well. I feel better after fast day and mentally quite righteous so choose to weigh myself once a week but to also use the trouser test and try on a tight pair of trousers once a week as well. Think whole picture not pound by pound slog! It becomes too much.<br>
Just have a go if anyhting else it makes you feel better.</p>

		<p>I work similar hours Laura and can eat my way through 1500 cals between 8pm and bedtime! So what I do is fast from either lunch to lunch or dinner to dinner or 7pm - 7pm etc This works for me. So last night i finsihed my fast at 8 pm and then ate a dinner. it was supposed to be 6pm but I didnt get in til 8pm. This fast/feast style is designed to work round you. I have thyroid probs so I dont lose the weight easily but i have to say I am doing this for health reasons and weight loss is a bonus! She said lying! That said, try it 500 cals over a 24hour period is do able. Soup for lunch, porridge for breakfast if you eat it, couple of snacks or good coffee! Have a go..and ask questions. This programme isnt rigid it flows iwth what and where you are at! If you blow your fast day then pick another day.</p>

		<p>I am getting married at the end of this year (December) and I want to try a healthy eating plan that will not just help me fit into my wedding dress!  I have never really stuck to a diet plan before, as my work has me returning late to my home each night and the temptation to just make a sandwich or pasta is difficult to overcome!  <br>
<br>
Does this work?  If so, from experience, what is the best way of working the fasting days?  I can make a lunch to take into work, but I'm concerned that I won't be able to stop myself from eating when I get in?  Do I need to fast all day, or can I make small meals to keep me going?<br>
<br>
I just desperately want to find something I can stick to, not just for my wedding but also for a healthier lifestyle!</p>

		<p>Hi June.... I make a dressing using a spoonful of plain low fat yog with a good squeeze of lemon juice and a little harissa  paste or curry paste or any spicy flavouring you like. <br>
Enjoy your Zumba.... just don't do anything too energetic on a fast day..... I find it's good to keep busy but not too physical on those days.</p>

		<p>Hi everyone<br>
going tostart the diet on tuesday and also going to go to Zumba class after work that day so lots to look forward to. I have ben looking for a nice salad dressing for fast days but cant find a nice spicey one that takes my fancy, anyone got any ideas?<br>
It has been great reading all the comments and advise, I will certainly be logging in regular to get inspiration and see how eveyone is doing, Ive tried on a pair of trousers that are a size 14 and can only just get the edges to meet, so these will be my mearure of how I am doing. Good luck to everyone !!</p>

		<p>Hi Erin, basic rules seem to be 500 ish calories over 24 hours beginning and ending as you wish. Ie by time 10am -10am , lunch to lunch etc. Doesnt matter how or what you eat as long as you have a 12 hour or so period food free i.e. when you sleep! I think this is why it seems too easy to stick to totally adaptable to you as long as you stick to... 500 ish cals and 24 hours.<br>
I sympatize with scales lark and as you have probably read in earlier posts, i use scales once a week after fast, have a tight pair of trousers and top which i try on once a week as well. I also have a hill (very small which I try to get up once a month- and judge my fitness by that as well)Scales are a b****r as I can gain wieght overnight despite being very good! I think you need a range or criteeria to inform your weight loss rather than depend on one -the scales- as for women especially it just isnt a true relection of your work. Have a go..dont obsess-although you will for first 2 weeks, and keep going!!!!!</p>

		<p>Hi everyone I'm going to give this a go starting tomorrow. I have been using My Finesses Pal to loose weight and saw that some days I can easily stick to 600 or 700 cal  so figure I could manage the 5:2. Can I drink black coffee and diet coke on fasting days (I know they are bad but don't think I can kick the coke habit)!! Also the scales are killing me was doing so well until I got on the scales and realized I hadent lost as much as I though even though I did loose some weight, it made me eat chocolate and drink wine!! So no more scales I think</p>

		<p>yes drink alchol but it has to be counted in your 500 cals! Just be wary as I get munchies when i drink! Cheese curls /quavers and a low fat yoghrt/cottage cheese whizzed up dip is nice to accompany your drinkies!<br>
I am startng again after lunch today-BAD two days after my online food shop! Pre mentrual does not help either. However i have walked so dont feel toooo awful or failing. <br>
Congratulations of WW loss as well.</p>

		<p>Hi - I have lost 22lbs on weight watchers and maintened my weight for nearly a year.  However, I would like to lose another half a stone and despite sticking to my WW plan my weight seems to have hit a plateau so I was thinking of starting this next week.  <br>
Does anyone know if you can drink alcohol when doing this - obviously not on the fasting days!  Thanks Louise.</p>

		<p>My advice, for what it's worth is to keep busy on a fast day but nothing strenuous. Also avoid food shopping. I also find lots of mugs of hot water helps ( see above ).  The great thing is knowing that the next day is "normal" .... and you'll feel SO virtuous at the end of the day. It's literally taking it one day at a time and it can be different days each week to fit in with what you are doing.... so good luck and keep in touch. We are all in this together !</p>

		<p>Ok chowed down big time on all goodies i had stupidly ordered so starting fast today earlier! never mind trousers fitting a little better and have lost a little wiehgt- although I have to say scales are dodgy from day to day anyway. I find fizzy water my god send. Havent had fizzzy drinks for years because they say not to drink fizzy drinks. But I have locked onto fizzy water and alovely elderflwoer cordial dash of! Dont worry about multiple blogs jo I have emailled them to ask if they will remove them we shall see if any one repilies. I find it interesting for a blog that noone from the website has said anything or replied to any of us or indeed just said Hi and good luck. It could just be us!</p>

		<p>Hi everyone ... Huge apologies for multiple comments yesterday . I must have accidentally hit a "Repeat - till - you - drive - everyone - nuts " button that I didn't know existed !<br>
Good luck with your fast Hannah . I find in this cold weather that numerous mugs of hot water , some with a slice each of fresh ginger and lemon or an inch or so of a cinnamon stick help to keep the body warm when food isn't there !</p>

		<p>Hi Jo, got shingles on boxing day and still trying to get through the night with no pain! Drugged up to the eyeballs which means my knitting is all over the place. However snow has overtaken any concerns and I await my food delivery from a well knwn brand with anticipation! fasting from Thursday lunch time to friday (pub lunch time)!</p>

		<p>Hannah, <br>
Welcome. I read the Michael Moseley book and watched the show. I have looked at the recipes above but find that I choose to eat the foods i normally do but just divide it up on fast days into 3 lots of 500 cals or so... porridge , soup, cottage cheese, fruit, thin ham, yoghurt .I also tend to do breakfast to breakfast or lunch to lunch or indeed 10 am -10 am for example. I also have a selection I my fridge so if i dont fancy something i can call on another and I log on fitness pal. I am on week 2 and am finding it do able.<br>
Good Luck</p>

		<p>Hi Hannah...welcome ! All the food can be got at the supermarket and on fast days the limit is 500 cals. which doesn't go very far. I'm splitting it into 2 mini meals ( breakfast and supper ) drinking green tea and hot water between... other people have different ways so you can  pick and mix . There is a book "the fasting diet " I think is what it's called by Michael Mosely . <br>
Anyway good luck and keep in touch</p>

		<p>Hi everyone, I'm new here and have only just discovered this diet! I'm getting married in September, so desperate to lose some weight before then. I was interested to know, the food listed here, can this all be bought from the supermarket or does it all need to be made from scratch? Also, I'm not sure if this is answered anywhere, but the days on, roughly how many calories should I be eating? Thank you!! Hannah xxx</p>

		<p>Poor you.... shingles is horrible. How long have you been suffering? Sometimes food is the ONLY answer , whether the pain is physical or mental. If you like I'll ask the kinesiologist if there's anything natural that might help.<br>
I'm doing a fast day today... oatbran porridge and kiwis eaten .... a long time to go till this evenings stirfry !<br>
Good luck to us all !</p>

		<p>Good for you Jo and well done for seeing a kinesiologist- I find them so fascinating- I am well into alternative therapies and medicines. So let me kow how you go. My stir fry with a little chilli sauce  (120cals) was delicious and followed by a low fat mocha choc coffee just topped it off! have soup with a plate of cottage cheese, toms, apple and pear for dinner tonight- something hot and something cold. I have to say fast days without carbs so much easier to do for me. Get your kinesiologist to ask about certain foods types that may help/hinder you as we do need to listen to our bodies and our minds more rather than over riding what they are telling us and letting dis-ease set in.<br>
Happy snow day!</p>

		<p>Thanks very much , Tracey, for your encouragement. You are absolutely right about not getting obsessed with the bathroom scales. I must try to concentrate on feeling better ( I do ). <br>
I am seeing my kinesiologist at the end of this week and she always has very wise words and has done a huge amount to help me through last year which was my "annus horribilis "<br>
Today is a food day and I intend to enjoy it , without being silly and I'll then be up for fasting 2 more days this week. <br>
Thanks again</p>

Have my stir fry in, my glorious soup etc. I find lunch to lunch better when I am not working the next day as breakfast I can do a small yoghurt/ banana smoothie til lunch. And my sleep-haha- at night means I am not thinking about food. Never mind its beautiful outside snowing so am rugging up to go shopping on the high street and shop for my older neighbours.</p>

		<p>Don't worry so did i! That's why I have other measures in place like measuring yourself and trying clothes on. Also dont forget you can wiegh more from one day to the next! I was heavier after fast day 3 but two days later had lost some. Your body is also getting used to it. What did you eat on your feast days? Dont forget it takes something like 3000 calories less to lose a pound in fat so look on this as a healthy diet and the weight loss is secondary. i too need to shift the wieght but do know I get so obsessed that when I have a week with no loss I give up! I dont think the meals and how many you divide it into really have much impact. Just do what is comfortable to you. Stick with it..</p>

		<p>I started the 5:2 diet last week and did 3 fast days , then weighed and found I'd GAINED nearly 2 lbs !<br>
I stuck rigidly to the 500 cals but did divide it into 3 meals not 2. Was this the problem ? <br>
Please help... today I'm doing just 2 meals divided by as close to 12 hours as I can.</p>

		<p>Plan your days to fast/feast but if it goes awry dont panic as there are other days. Thats the key- it has to fit n with you , your lifestyle and daily hiccups! The thing I am finding is that it is manageable and not particularly hard to stick too.</p>

		<p>Hello there Elizabeth, I am 47 and I too have lots to loose from thyroid problems over ten years ago- ie no thyroid now. I had lost 3 stone but put on one and a half- now have five stone to loose- God that sounds immense and honestly I dont look too massive! i am doing fast day then normal one and a half days  then fast day- ie I start mine at lunch time, But I am off work with shingles which is horrible and painful. I am active, healthy eater 75% of the time but i comfort eat, chocolate is great for pain! I walk at least three times a week in the hills, I set up a walking club in fact to make me go out as I got to the stage where I was sick of going alone. I live in a small village so resources for wieght loss re limited. Hence finding this site and this diet. I have lost a little weight week one and my trousers do seem a smidgen smaller. I have to say on my feast days i eat normal food but only 1200 ish cals of it.<br>
My tips are to find the times that suit you, I plan my food but often dont fancy it so I have a frdige of back up ideas. i think if you enjoy your meal is fills you emotionally for longer and that is what people forget when they diet is the mental/emotional highs and lows!<br>
Good luck this week.</p>

		<p>Ok so what's the feeling of letting a girl from Missouri USA be a part of a UK conversation? I've been looking for something that will help me lose 20 lbs or at least 2 sizes, but at 52 need more of a lifestyle change instead of a quick fix (although that' d be nice too!) I lost, a year and a half ago, what I' d call my baby weight, my baby' s 20! It was long overdue. I swore I'd never gain it again,  but guess what? Life happens and I let my guard down. This looks like a plan where I can have my whiskey and drink it too (all within moderation of course!). Tabitha on boubonandpearls mentioned it in one of her latest posts, so I've been giving the topic some research. I found this site and am finding it to be more than giving me answers about the 5:2, but also info on everything that a 52 y/o might need to know about holding onto youth and fighting age. I refuse to age gracefully, but rather kicking and screaming, all bets are off. I'll use whatever arsenal I can get my hands on! A good start is losing this weight. I'll be checking on the meal plans and the comments regularly, nothins' better than hearing from someone living it. <br>
What's the best time to start this plan? Monday to Sunday with Monday &amp; Wednesday the fast days?<br>
I like the idea of using fitness pal too.<br>
Thanks for the venue!</p>

		<p>With regards to weight I have put a pair of trousers/jacket that just fit in my wardrobe and try them on weekly- that way I dont get hung up on scales! Again my obsession and downfall! Also have measured my waist and tummy and just do that after a fast day onc a week. i must have lost a little as trousers fitting a little better. So game on......<br>
On feast days i use fitness pal 1200 cals but eat normal food and if I want a choc bar/ etc I plan it in with a walk to counter act it.</p>

		<p>Thanks Jennifer, yes I thought it was that- I have since read the book on Kindle and basically it was saying not to get too hung up on the 24 hours thing and to adapt it to suit you. I have to say I have done 3 fasts this week- alternate days and am in a funny way enjoying it all! Scary!  I already log my food on fitness pal. I have done yesterdays fast using protein and veg/fruit  only - no carbs- ( My downfall) and found it so easy! I have thoroughly enjoyed my white bread bacon sandwich this lunch time! I even went out for a long snowy walk before tea last night and was fine. As for foods I now have a selection in my fridge of fasting foods should i choose to do whatever day next week. Stir frys - 35 cals a pack- red milk-good quality yoghurt, soups in cartons etc or homemade etc. I am doing this for health reasons and also wieght reasons so all good so far. I have come to the idea that quality is better that low fat versions. I also love fizzy water- with elderflower cordial or lemon- delicious. I find when you look at a lot of book recipes for things like this the recipes are so 'posh' I just want normal food! I also split my food up as I find night times awful so i eat as late as possible and postpone breakfast to leter on etc. Also a milky/ low cal choc before bed is a treat.<br>
Good luck every body, just give it a go, dont get hung up on the rights and wrongs and if you use 550/600 cals then so be it! it should be unique to you. The 12 hour non food period seems to be the main thing 16 if you can but again just do what you can do.</p>

		<p>I've only started the 5:2 plan this week. I notice in the Week One plan that it has full-fat Greek yoghurt instead of non-fat. I've been reading a lot about how non-fat dairy may actually be less healthy for you &amp; was wondering if anyone had more info about this?. I had bought 0% Fage Greek yoghurt because of the calorie count for fast days but am not thinking it may now be better to return to the more tasty full fat version. Any tips would be appreciated!</p>

		<p>Hi Tracey,<br>
<br>
I'm not an expert but I am doing the eating plan as well. I would say that it is from the time that you stop eating. So if you eat at 12:00pm but you finish it at 12:30pm, then it would be 12:30pm to 12:30pm. I guess if even wanted to be more strict, it would start 2-3 hours after you last ate as that is when the food would be digested. Does that make sense? Anyways, I'm on my first week of 5:2. I fasted on Monday and Wednesday. I'm finding, though, that I'm eating a lot on the eating days, but it all healthy food that I crave. I'm hoping once I adjust to the eating schedule I start to eat a bit less on the eating days as well. <br>
What do you think? Lost any weight yet?</p>

		<p>Onto my second Fasting day- cancelled yesterdays effort when I fell at the last hurdle and ate too much! However on target to suceed with this one. I would like clarification if anyone knows,<br>
I am doing lunchtime to lunchtime or dinner time to dinner time etc via a time so 12-12 or 5-5. So question is: I eat meal at 12 then begin fast 24 hours on 500 calories up to 12 the next day then start my normal 1200/1300 from then. In other words is the time straight after my las normal meal as it were?</p>
