<div class="pageText">
	<p class="intro">If heat rash is making life a living hell, read on for the experts' advice on what causes prickly heat, how to get rid of it and how to keep your cool</p>
<p>I don't do well in hot weather. Recently in an impromptu outdoor meeting in the glorious sunshine, I returned to the office with tan lines (read: burn lines) that normally I'd struggle to achieve with a week in Ibiza. But while I scolded myself for not using SPF that morning, I secretly revelled in the fact that there was no sign of prickly heat on top of my lobster-shaded skin. The realisation helped ease the pain of the heat radiating from my arms (thank goodness for air con).</p>
<p>Prickly heat, heat rash or 'sweat rash' as it might be known (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.britishskinfoundation.org.uk/SkinInformation/AtoZofSkindisease/PLE.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">polymorphic light eruption or PLE</a> - see below) has plagued me, on and off, for as long as I can remember. Being <a href="../listing/sense-and-sensitivity.html">sensitive</a>, I'm always on the lookout for the beginnings of rashes or reactions, but there's none I dread more than the early signs of heat rash - those little red spots that start to appear on my wrists and the folds of my forearms, which I know within hours will be right up to my shoulders.</p>
<p>As a friend and fellow sufferer once said to me, "Once you look down and see it - you know that's it." It's spoiled many a holiday, or indeed many a sunny day that should be spent frolicking outdoors and soaking up the vitamin D (responsibly, of course; SPF always included). Itchy, sore and unsightly, it can make summer a living hell. But what causes it and is there any way to stop those spots from creeping up on us? I asked the experts to find out once and for all...</p>
<h2><strong>What is prickly heat?</strong></h2>
<p>"Prickly heat, heat rash or sweat rash are all names used for a condition called miliaria," explains <a href="https://www.getthegloss.com/expert/dr-stefanie-williams">Dr Stefanie Williams</a>, Dermatologist and Medical Director of Eudelo. "It occurs when sweat ducts get obstructed, sweat leaks into the skin and the skin gets inflamed around that tiny leakage. A prickly rash appears with red, very itchy little bumps (papules)."</p>
<p>The sweat ducts are blocked either by excessive sweating, or by an overgrowth of bacteria which normally lives on our skin, Cosmetic Dermatologist <a href="../expert/samantha-bunting.html">Dr Sam Bunting</a> tells me. "[This] leads to a sticky byproduct blocking up the delicate sweat ducts, trapping sweat under the skin. It's exacerbated if sweat is trapped and can't escape."</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="../gallery/sense-and-sensitivity-the-best-sun-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">MORE GLOSS: The best sun creams for sensitive skin</span></a><br></span></p>
<h2><strong>Who suffers from it?</strong></h2>
<p>"It is very common (up to 30% of people may develop this under certain conditions) and is most common in hot, humid climates," says Dr Williams. "Younger children are particularly at risk. Typical body areas are skin folds (or on the back if a patient is bed-bound). The risk of getting it can also be increased if you use quite heavy, occluding skincare.</p>
<p>“However, sometimes when people speak about a sweat rash, they might possibly mean a fungal infection in skin-on-skin areas such as the groins or under the breasts. The medical term for this is Intertrigo and it’s a common fungal yeast infection that occurs between the folds of your skin as a result of humidity, friction and a lack of ventilation. It usually shows up as a red, itchy rash on in skin folds.”</p>
<p>You don’t have to have a history of prickly heat to get it, either - it can happen at any time if you’re in the right (or should I say wrong) conditions.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, though, that many people think they're suffering with heat rash when in fact they are reacting to sun cream - it took me years to realise the extra-bad itchy rashes I was experiencing on holidays were from the bottles of sun cream I'd been slathering on all week and the fragrances, preservatives and chemical sun creams in them. So do check that this isn't the case first (<a href="sense-and-sensitivity-sun-cream-for-sensitive-skin.html">see my guide to SPF for sensitive skin here</a>).</p>
<h2><strong>What is PLE?</strong></h2>
<p>Rashes are characteristically hard to diagnose, and though less likely than heat rash it could be that you’re suffering with a sun allergy or polymorphic light eruption (PLE).</p>
<p>Dr Williams explains: “They can look quite similar, but while heat rash occurs mostly in occluded skin areas prone to sweating, PLE occurs on skin that has been exposed to the sun recently (but traditionally might be covered with clothing, so isn’t ‘used’ to the sun).”</p>
<p>So what causes it? “PLE is a common form of a reaction to UV light that often occurs in young women in spring and summer (or at the start of a sunny holiday). The name ‘polymorphic’ refers to the fact that the rash can appear in many different shapes or forms, although in one person it usually looks the same every time it appears. The arms, the chest and lower legs/feet may be affected. The face is usually spared (as it tends to be more ‘hardened’ to sun light). The commonest form of PLE presents as crops of itchy, 2–5 mm pinkish ‘bumps’. In some people tiny blisters may occur. PLE persists for some days (or longer if the affected skin is exposed to more sunlight) before spontaneously resolving without scarring.”</p>
<p>Unless you can get your skin used to the sun slowly and gradually throughout the seasons, it’s likely you’ll suffer from it every year. Treating PLE is a case of using steroid creams or oral steroids if it occurs, or preventing it using specialised UV machines to ‘harden up’ the skin and prep it for exposure. “Most importantly, stay out of the sun, once you have it (until it’s fully gone),” says Dr Williams. “Antihistamines can help with the itch too.”</p>

<h2><strong>How can you prevent prickly heat?</strong></h2>
<p>The million dollar question. Given that the cause is the body's natural response to the heat, it's very difficult to manage which is no doubt why it causes so much stress to so many people. The key thing here is to keep your cool; easier said than done in heat waves such as we've experienced this week but essential to keep those little bumps at bay.</p>
<p>"Prevention includes, most importantly, to avoid sweating as much as possible. Even if you manage this for only a few hours per day (e.g. an air-conditioned office), this already helps," explains Dr Williams. "Also avoid over-dressing, occlusive clothes (wear breathable clothing e.g. light cotton) and friction/rubbing from clothes. Furthermore you should avoid any irritation of the skin (e.g. excessive soap etc.)"</p>

<p>It's of course a little harder to avoid hotter climes on holiday but there are ways to keep your skin as sweat-free as possible. "A dip in the pool or cool shower can stop sweating," explains Dr Bunting, "and avoid sticky skincare and sunscreens, which will have an occlusive effect on skin by trapping sweat." Check out our <a href="https://www.getthegloss.com/article/how-to-stop-excessive-sweating">guide to preventing excessive sweating here</a>, and my pick of the <a href="../gallery/sense-and-sensitivity-the-best-sun-creams-for-sensitive-skin.html">best sun creams for sensitive skin here</a> - pick your formula carefully and you might just avoid it.</p>
<p>Some readers have suggested (see the comments below) that using an anti-bacterial Dettol soap to wash with has helped them to keep the rashes away - but what’s the expert view on using such a harsh detergent on <a href="../listing/sense-and-sensitivity.html">sensitive skin</a>? I asked Dr Williams. “In this particular case, it might have worked, as the soap reduced the bacterial overgrowth on the skin, which in some cases can be involved in the genesis of prickly heat. Everybody is different, but it wouldn’t be a treatment I would recommend routinely.” Knowing my own sensitivities, I wouldn’t try it myself - but if your skin is otherwise robust aside from heat rash then it’s certainly worth a try.</p>
<h2><strong>How to get rid of prickly heat</strong></h2>
<p>So you’ve tried your best, but the rash has still appeared. What to do? Well if prevention is difficult, treatment is a pain when it comes to prickly heat - everyone has their own answers but ultimately, it’s hard to get rid of once the rash begins.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself and you shouldn't have to suffer for too long. Here are my top five tips for curing it once you've got it.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Do NOT scratch</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Take antihistamines up to two weeks before you go on holiday (check with your doctor first - your GP can also prescribe some) or as soon as you start to develop the rash</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Shop for over the counter sprays and remedies (but with minimal ingredients - this is definitely a case of less is more. Fragrance has no place here). <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2041&amp;awinaffid=203429&amp;clickref=&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2Fen%2FOdaban-Antiperspirant-spray_1116405%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Odaban</a>, £8.99 is an antiperspirant spray that's perfume-free and based on aluminium salt to reduce excess sweating; <a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=272492766" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Magicool Plus Prickly Heat</a>, £8 is a topical spray that cools the skin and is even prescribed on the NHS for moderate to severe cases; the <a href="http://www.effortlessskin.com/p-3487-aqualual.aspx?gclid=Cj0KEQjwxZieBRDegZuj9rzLt_ABEiQASqRd-ozSk1uIustpFogxwERugmGyoCKQcYb7fv3NK-5L7VAaAjCx8P8HAQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hyalual Aqualual Melt Water spray</a>, from £12 is cooling and super hydrating, with hyaluronic acid; and lastly <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2041&amp;awinaffid=203429&amp;clickref=&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2Fen%2FAvene-Thermal-Water-Spray-300ml_1261959%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eau Thermale Avene's Thermal Spring Water Spray</a>, £10, is a great handbag essential for calming skin on the go.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> "[Leave] the area as open and ‘ventilated’ as possible," advises Dr Williams, and try "cold water compresses and calamine lotion plus a light emollient (as calamine on its own can dry the skin and irritate a little)." I love <a href="http://www.pharmacyfirst.co.uk/care-aqueous-calamine-cream-100g-carh196430461.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Care's Aqueous Calamine Cream</a>, £1.69, which has fixed my heat rash every year I've had it - buy online or find in your local pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Bathe it if needed in cool water. "If it's very itchy, try a colloidal oatmeal bath (like the Aveeno one, £8.19, great for kids) and use a mild topical steroid for a few days," adds Dr Bunting.</p>

		<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you! I was on holiday in the Canaries for a fortnight when I developed prickly heat on my décolletage. I've had it before and many a holiday it's spoilt. I know not to take Ibuprofen, as that can aggravate it. I was taking anti-histamines for a couple of weeks before travelling and that didn't seem to help, but perhaps I need to be taking Piriton more regularly, rather than the one-a-day antihistamines. <br>
<br>
I'd not heard about the Dettol soap theory and was willing to give it a try. Couldn't find any where we were staying, but I did have a Boots antibacterial handwash that I'd picked up in the airport. It had to be worth a try, didn't it?  Well, let's just say that I was astonished to find that using the handwash several times during the day to wash the affected area really reduced my rash and made it comfortable to be out in the sun. Result!!<br>
<br>
I've found some Dettol soap on my return to the UK (Home Bargains, a 3-pack) and have it in my holiday drawer for the next sunshine break. <br>
<br>
I'll also consider some of the other tips as well. So glad I found this website when I searched for "prickly heat", it may well be a skin saver.</p>

		<p>This blog is very useful and thank you all. I have just read that in Australia DETTOL antibacterial soap has been removed and replaced by a Dettol soap with different ingredients because the antibacterial agents in the soap are possible causing superbugs. I am rather dismayed at this as the soap has been so helpful for my heat rash. Apparently we are following suit after the US banned some of the chemicals eg; triclosan. This ban came in September 2016 and I notice on ebay the price of this soap has skyrocketed and is only available from overseas now. Does this mean PH sufferers have to look elsewhere for cheap and succesful relief?</p>

trying every cream, spray, Tablet ,Gel, nothing worked, <br>
 I can never go in the sea and not even staying under the umbrella stopped it, Then I read about Eucerin Sun Allergy Protection Cream Gel SPF50 and OMG I have just arrived back from Mallorca in 30cc sunshine after applying lashing off this cream before leaving my room I am rash FREE, this is the 1st time ever that I have  come back to work and not had to cover my unsightly skin  I even went in the sea at least 3 times a day on a Lilo making sure to keep my chest out of the salt water I didn't want to push my luck, <br>
It may not work for everyone but Im am so excited about this product I will stock up, the test will be in Cyprus next year I will brave the swimming pool,  Good Luck Its worth a go.</p>

		<p>I have been plagued with ple for the last 6 years-10 holidays ruined even after various research and different methods I've had no success! Until now I'm just home from a week in Tenerife after reading this blog I decided I'd give dettol soap a go (was still sceptical after all it's a £1 bar of soap) I showered morning and night with it and bought Eucerine allergy sun cream specific to PLE too. I still kept my other few wee routines strongest antihistamine perceived by gp and three short sun beds the week before (which has helped symptoms on a past holiday)! The results were incredible I wish I could post the comparison picture I have of my hand from last year. Honestly give the soap a go even when I got a small amount of rash on my stomach after washing with it, it had total eased to nothing by next morning! Thanks so much to this blog- I go to Mexico in March for my honeymoon so this holiday was my last attempt to find something!</p>

		<p>Have to start by saying this article and comments saved my holiday! I'm in DR at the moment and had the worst flare up of prickly heat ever after 4 days here, I tried everything to get rid of it, even medicated soaps designed to ease the discomfort! After a few days of of pulling my hair out I managed to get some soap identical to dettol (dettol not available here) 3 days later, washing morning and evening, the rash has virtually gone even with me still using standard Piz Buin SPF 15 and enjoying the sun! Can not recommend the dettol soap enough (or one identical in ingredients) and a decent moisturiser.</p>

		<p>Has anyone tried having a few sessions in the sauna before going on holiday? As I have seen on the internet that prickly heat sufferers say that going in the sauna before going on holiday opens up the sweat pores so when they go in the sun or a hot climate their pores are fresh. I would like to know if this does actually work as I also suffer with prickly heat. I hope this method works...</p>

After suffering prickly heat for many years and tried many remedies but nothing helped. I always took antihistamine before going on holiday and during my holiday but it never worked. I also used many different sun creams. Last year I used elemis’ tan accelerator before I went on holiday along with beta carotene vitamins from Holland and barret and it still came out but not as bad. This year I researched more on this site and took advice on sun tan lotions which were a godsend as for the first year ever I did not get prickly heat. I took the beta carotene vitamins two weeks before and during my two week holiday. I got a bar of anti bacterial dettol soap and showered with it in the morning then applied solbar thirsty sunscreen which was a factor30 and was alcohol gel based. I was out in the sun all day and only applied it a couple of times a day. After sunbathing I showered with the dettol soap and applied my aftersun which I always stick to aloe vera. I could not believe it no itch no spots what a difference. I bought two different recommended sun screens but the other was green people organic which I had to use at the end of my holiday as I run out of the solbar thirsty and felt it was too thick and would not rub in and I did feel a itch starting but after showering with the soap it calmed down so I would not recommend the green people sunscreen. I hope this helps others as it makes such a difference to your holiday.</p>

		<p>I have always, since travelling abroad (never really get it in the UK), remember suffered viciously with Prickly Heat... and this year on my 4th day into a 2 trip to Miami I was faced with the worst PH I've ever had!! I visited a pharmacy and they advised to get out of the sun ASAP or id be taking a trip to the docs (which I clearly didn't need on holiday!!). I spent the afternoon doing more research on how to avoid PH and to ease it when it occurs, when I read about sun cream being the main cause of PH due to the chemical content and the combination of that on your skin and the sun rays (*also, the higher the factor the more chemical are contained, so steer clear of 30+! ...Apparently if you use spray sun lotion, there are even more chemicals contained in it which allows it to be sprayed - so another one to avoid) So, out of sheer desperation I went back to the pharmacy the following morning and found a sun cream which was free of everything but what a sun cream should be - Hypoallergenic, Oil Free Zinc based, Broad Spectrum, fragrance free sun lotion in a factor 15 and literally within a DAY it was gone!! So the tip from me is BUY A OIL FREE sun cream with the extra sensitive measures....it seemed to work for me and I've ALWAYS been a sufferer. :D (Coppertone do one in factor 30 (so just on the border of being ok based on what I've said), and Hawaiian Tropic do an Oil Free factor 15.... perhaps see if they work for you... I'm looking forward to my next holiday now!!</p>

		<p>After an awful 4 days of prickly heat had nearly driven me to distraction and having unsuccessfully tried everything recommended mentioned on here my local pharmacist recommended Vitamin Dermina powder - I live in Malta and not sure if this is widely available elsewhere but I do know its avialable from Amazon and is only about 6 pounds - within half an hour the itch had gone and after several more applications throughout the day the rash which was pretty much all over me had disappeared completely. I would highly recommend anyone who suffers with PH to get some of this powder.</p>

		<p>Thanks to all who've post on here as its really helped me as a new sufferer!<br>
<br>
I've used the Dettol Soap twice a day followed by Aveeno Moisturiser Cream with colloidial oats as it doesn't block the pores and helps to keep dead skin reduced.<br>
<br>
So far it's been great and a very easy routine to follow but for my next holiday I'll take antihistamines and sunbeds a few weeks prior just to be sure.<br>
<br>
Fingers crossed!</p>

		<p>So I live in the UK and I can't say we are having a particularly great summer... It's been raining a lot of the time but around about the 20degrees mark and I my chest has been covered in prickly heat for 3 weeks solid!!! <br>
I have been to the doctors twice (for what it was worth) and they have given me prescription antihistamine and antibiotics, I am also using hydrocortisone cream! I am bathing every day and using e45 soaps! I am wearing lose clothing! <br>
I am at the end of my teather... I can't sleep properly for itching, nothing is calming it down and it looks awful... After 3 constant weeks (with probably 2 days where it eased off a little) I don't know what to do.... Any help or advice would be amazing?<br>
Do we agree dettol soap would be worth a go... Anyone had anything from the doctors that's helped?</p>

<br>
When I got to Spain I still had a few lumps but they didn't itch, I then used the P20 lotion as recommended &amp; washed with DETTOL soap morning and night and the prickly heat did ***NOT***return. I was able to sit out in the sun for 5-6 hours a day without a problem :)</p>

		<p>I've suffered really badly with this for the last 5 years :( <br>
<br>
Only started getting it when I was 35... Every holiday since was an absolute nightmare as all sufferers will know (Rash/Blisters &amp; Itching).<br>
<br>
I went on holiday in June and desperately wanted to avoid it... Did the research online, lots of trawling the web for cures &amp; remidies so this was my plan:<br>
<br>
Taking Citrazine (Anti histamine) for 3 weeks before<br>
Using Elemis Tan Acc for 2 weeks before<br>
5-6 Sunbeds from 4 mins rising to 8 mins<br>
Using P20 suntan lotion (Factor 50/30 &amp; 20).<br>
<br>
Costs:<br>
<br>
Citrazine (Anti Histamine) was £5/$7<br>
Tan Acc wasn't cheap (£65/$90 for 400ml)<br>
Sunbeds (Approx £45/$60)<br>
P20 was £17/$24 per bottle (3 Bottles).<br>
<br>
3 days before my holiday we had a bit of nice weather (75 degrees - I live in the UK &amp; 75 degs with sun is nice weather :) so I sat out in the sun for 30 mins without lotion. <br>
<br>
Within an hour of me coming back indoors the itchin started and lumps appeared, I almost cried... <br>
<br>
I re-read all the forums panicking as I was going in 3 days and 30 mins in the UK sun had brought the rash out so what chance did I have in the Spanish sun?!? The only thing I hadn't tried was DETTOL SOAP... <br>
<br>
I'd seen it recommended above but didn't think a cheap bar of soap would fix the problem.<br>
<br>
How wrong I was... Washed with it morning and night for the following 3 days and avoided the sun... The rash went down within 2 days &amp; more importantly the itching stopped almost immediately. <br>
<br>
When I got to Spain I still had a few lumps but they didn't itch, I then used the P20 lotion as recommended &amp; washed with DETTOL soap morning and night and the prickly heat did return. I was able to sit out in the sun for 5-6 hours a day without a problem :) <br>
<br>
I returned 7 days later with a deep golden tan, probably the brownest I've ever been, I'm blond so have always gone red before I eventually went a light shade of brown.<br>
<br>
So DETTOL soap is the way forward... <br>
<br>
The results were amazing.<br>
<br>
Some comments on the 4 ways I tried to avoid:<br>
<br>
Citrazine/Anti Histamine:<br>
<br>
I've taken this alone on previous holidays and it's made no difference apart that it made me very drousy at night which I didn't like.<br>
<br>
Elemis Tan Accelerator:<br>
<br>
Yes it's expensive but I've never been so tanned so thumbs up for this.<br>
<br>
Sunbeds:<br>
<br>
I'm not a big fan of these but did give me a little colour before I went abroad.<br>
<br>
P20 Lotion:<br>
<br>
Although expensive compared to other lotions it seemed to work great, it's advertised as a once a day lotion but I applied twice sometimes three times just to be sure and had no problems.<br>
<br>
It's available as a spray bottle or a nomal suntan lotion bottle, the spray bottle didn't work as well due to the lotion being quite dry, ie by the time you spray yourself and try to rub it in, it has already dried so you couldn't see where you'd covered and where you hadn't.<br>
<br>
I also used a Prickly Heat Spray called 'Magicool Prickly Heat Spray' which worked very well on the rash in conjunction with the DETTOL soap when the rash appeared in the UK before I went on holiday.<br>
<br>
To summarise:<br>
<br>
DO NOT go out in the sun without lotion on, not even for 5 minutes, as soon as you burn in the slightest the rash will start to appear and it's a downhill slope from there, yes the soap is amazing but if you can avoid getting burn to start it makes it even better :) <br>
<br>
Use Tan Accelerator if you like, it certainly improved my tan and smelt nice.<br>
<br>
Definitely use DETTOL soap :))) It's amazing and I no longer dread going to sunny climates.<br>
<br>
He's some links for the Soap and the Magicool in the States, this is a US site after all so would be rude to give all the info in £'s and UK websites :))) <br>
<br>
DETTOL Soap:<br>
<br>
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/cr/B000JWO870/ref=mw_dp_cr<br>
<br>
Magicool Spray:  <br>
<br>
https://www.chemist-4-u.com/magicool-plus-prickly-heat-spray-150ml.html<br>
<br>
Apols for the long post, I just wanted to share the love for DETTOL soap and let fellow sufferers know the lengths I went to avoid the dreaded rash and the discomfort it brings :))) <br>
<br>
Good luck, I hope it works for you...</p>

		<p>I have suffered with prickly heat all my life.  Tried everything.  On a recent holiday to Cyprus I brought P20.  Not one spot and I had the best holiday laying in the sun without issue. P20 although expensive is simply brilliant. You also only need to put it on once in a morning. No burns, no sweating and more importantly no prickly heat.</p>

		<p>I have always suffered with prickly heat/heat rash. I'm currently sitting in the shade in Skiathos in tears as I am in so much pain with it! I have been taking antihistamines for weeks before I came and since arriving a week ago. I have been using dettol soap 3 times a day, I have been staying shaded as much as possible. I am using aloe Vera and allergy cream as well as allergy piz buin sunscreen. NOTHING HAS WORKED!! My arms, shoulders, back and chest are covered and I honestly can't quite describe the pain/burn I am experiencing. Meanwhile my boyfriend is lying happily in the sun enjoying our holiday. Honestly, any other suggestions would be amazing! :(</p>

		<p>I have loved all this advice and will definitely be buying some Dettol soap on the way home. One thing I thought I would add that has helped both myself and my mum is dry body brushing. The first time we realised this it was completely by accident. We were both at a day spa and the woman doing our massage body brushed us to within an inch of our life, it was actually a little painful. I was going on holiday the following day and no prickly heat that whole holiday. I mentioned it to my mum and it kind of made sense to remove any dead skin cells and that might aid in the sweat not being so easily trapped. So, she tried it and she too had less of a case of it than normal. I would suggest doing it for as long as you can before you go though, I think normal brushing for a couple of weeks works better than just doing it the day before (unless like the lady that gave me a massage you do it really harshly).</p>

		<p>Hi guys<br>
I've suffered from sensitive skin and prickly heat for 16 plus years I also suffer from allergic reaction to chlorine. With all this in mind holidays can be a nightmare for me and my family due to being itchy not wanting to participate in activities in the water or the sun. I'm just after any best practices that anyone uses I'm at the end of my tether I've used aloe based products, antihistamines,different suntan lotions. <br>
I'm definitely going to try the dettol soap which has been advised many thanks xx</p>

		<p>I have suffered from prickly heat for many many years and it has ruined many a holiday. In fact I'm currently in Cape Verde sitting in the hotel reception because of another bad dose of it. This time it's spread all over my legs, arms, back and chest. I could kick myself for not following what prevented it last holiday!<br>
We arrived and the weather was cloudy although still very warm and I thought I'd be OK.   By the second day the flare up had started!<br>
As Dennis Finnegan (August 2015 comments) suggested, I believe it is a bacteria in the skin which reacts with heat.<br>
A friend of mine who also suffers from this had read about the bacteria and DETTOL SOAP. I used DETTOL soap every morning and evening in the shower on our last holiday and can honestly say that it definitely kept the rash away. I couldn't believe the result and something so simple could prevent the rash!  If anything I actually stayed out in the sun longer than usual just to see how much I could get away with it and a very very tiny rash had started but soon dissipated/kept under control by my vigilant use of DETTOL soap.<br>
I've bought some with me on this holiday and having been caught out.  I have started using it from yesterday and can see a result already. I don't think it'll completely go this time as it has very quickly spread like wildfire but staying out of the sun for a couple of days and DETTOL scrubbing and my usual antihistamines will see it calmed down tremendously I'm sure.<br>
If I were to give any advice it would be using the soap morning and evening and an antihistamine for extra protection.<br>
I have seen the doctor here this morning  and she has also suggested getting a shot of Prednisolon BEFORE going on holiday next time<br>
Really hope this helps you. I can only go on what has certainly worked for me.<br>
On closing I just want to say I'm NEVER going to be slack on this preventative care regime again...lesson learnt !!<br>
Happy rash free holidays everyone! </p>

		<p>I've suffered for year with Prickly Heat, I use Piriton antihistamines and Piz Buin Alleregy sun cream - If I take the Piriton for a few days before I go on holidays or if I know there is going to be good weather and use the sun cream and I dont get it at all. Once I stick to that</p>

		<p>Well i have read the article about what ingredients to avoid for prickly heat but now i cant find a good one to use, i'm now confused,they all have the ingredients in there somewhere even the Alovera which is supposed to be natural. I have used piz buin,calypso and soltan.the calypso and piz buin gave me a rash on my legs,but no where else.The P20 and even Ladival from boots says it prevents prickly heat,but also has the ingredients in. Any ideas please??</p>

		<p>i have been a suffer of prickley heat for years and years there is absolutely nothing that will stop the preventing of prickly heat until i did my own experiment. I have taken tablets prescribed from the doctors also creams but to no avail nothing could prevent it, after the rash had appeared i put on all the creams to calm it down, but spraying myself with cool water was the only thing that calmed it down.  THEN someone told me to have sun showers three weeks before my holiday(i know some people are against the use of these) but i gave it a go.  I went for the very first sunshower and low and behold by prickly heat flared up just like i was in a hot climate(3mins only) then the next time i went which was four days later lathered myself with DETTOL soap and the rash came out again (3mins only) not as bad as the first. I repeated this for 3weeks and by the end of the 3weeks low and behold i only had a very small rash which i could live with.  This prepped my skin ready for the hot climate, and i was able to enjoy my holiday without an unsightly red rash.  I must say when you go out in that glorious sunshine, never spray perfume or wear any suncreams with perfume in them, and before you go out make sure you shower of the perfume from the night before and shower with DETTOL soap hope this helps because the sunshowers have helped me:):):)</p>

		<p>I am fair-skinned and live in the tropics - in Bali. Heat is not a problem but when the humidity hits I ALWAYS suffer from itchy, uncomfortable prickly heat in my armpits. I have tried calamine lotion, mangos, etc., etc. Now I have found the cure for me - it might not be great for you but is certainly worth a try! It is a cream, Esperson Desoximetasone. For me, it is like magic. Within 36 hours I am cured - every time!</p>

		<p>Hi all ... <br>
<br>
As a long time prisoner of prickly heat I have been subjected to sitting in the shade or in some instances sat in my hotel, or villa due to the unbearable pain and discomfort. I have just experienced the worst out break of PH whilst on my honeymoon in the Maldives and was confined to my hotel room for 3 days straight. I had tried all of the suggested remedies but to no avail, until .... A french doctor who happened to over hear my wife's conversation with reception jumped in and kindly provided us with a pack of steroid tablets called PREDNISOLONE 20mg, which he recommended i take 4 tablets for the first two days and then gradually reduce the dosage (as i am a stockier build 96kg he suggested I take 80mg for the first two days then slowly reduce to 60, 40 etc.). Within a day the rash began to disappear and I could finally sit out in the sun without my PH flaring up. In addition to the tablets the resort doctor also provided me with a steroid based topical solution called BEPROGEL and a cream called H-CORT (basically Hydrocortisone) which i applied 2-3 times daily to ensure the PH didn't return. <br>
<br>
What worked for me was undoubtedly the tablets, topical solution and the cream. Obviously consult your doctor before but I will now be telling my GP / Doc that the above are the only solution to a PH free holiday. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps guys!<br>
<br>
Happy Holidays</p>

		<p>Thanks for the article and all the useful tips folk have provided - I've made a note of all the different products to try for next year's holiday. I first developed prickly heat when I was 27 prior to that I actually spent 5 years working overseas as a holiday rep and used ridiculous local tan creams that contained olive oil and lemon juice among other things (it was the early 90s and we weren't so safe skin aware!) I always used a low factor despite having fair skin and used to get a tan with no rashes. It seemed like the first time I developed it was when I finally started using a high factor sun cream and over the years I've tried all sorts of different creams for sensitive skin but nothing seems to work. I thought I had finally cracked it this year using Calypso once a day as it is a liquid and I thought it wouldn't block my pores the way the thicker creams do. Unfortunately around day 3 or 4 of my week long holiday the dreaded rash appeared on my chest, neck, tops of my arms and even strangely this time on  my hands, feet and knees as well! It really ruins my holiday as I end up staying in the shade and covering up so to find something that will prevent it happening or at least keep it to a minimum would be wonderful. I'd love to know why I suddenly developed it after years of being ok in the sun but I guess I'll never know!</p>

		<p>I previously posted this on Channel 4's embarrassing bodies but it seems to be gone since so re-posting it here as I think it has helped a lot of people over the years and it has worked every years since...<br>
<br>
I feel like we may have found the solution to my wife’s prickly heat and I want to share it with those looking for a solution, especially, when I didn’t see this posted anywhere during my searches.<br>
<br>
She literally tried every preventative measure we could find and we tried every suggestion people gave us because everyone seems to think they know the answer. Truth be told, I’m sure a lot of these things worked for other people but not my wife.<br>
<br>
So let’s do a quick run down on everything she tried:<br>
<br>
Before we start, you can assume we did all the no brainer stuff like trying to keep cool, not pilling on the creams too much, not using cheap sun creams, showering before and after being in the sun and regular dips in the water and the rest, so assume all that and we’ll get to the suggestions for people who really have to struggle with this, bar the suggestion of staying out of the sun, that’s a pretty annoying suggestion, please don’t make it!<br>
<br>
1) Hypo Allergenic Sun Creams: These were one of the first thing she tried this year and we brought Soltan and Piz Buin factor 15s and they did seem to help but like many of these things, there may have been a marginal improvement and it’s hard to attribute it to any of these things. Marginal though, still aint gona cut it for anyone who has had this.<br>
<br>
2) Antihistamine Tablets: She started taking these 2 weeks before we went on holidays. It didn’t work last year and it didn’t work this year. I don’t think it made any difference at all!<br>
<br>
3) Vitamin C: Ok so this one really seems like a bit of an old wives tale but she was willing to try anything so we gave it a go this year. Of course it did absolutely nothing, although at this stage, the marginal improvement we had this year before the final solution, as apposed to last year could be down to any of these.<br>
<br>
4) Non Perfumed Toiletries: So this is a common one you hear, and who knows, maybe that is what causes it for some people. For my wife, taking non perfumed, shower gel, soap, shampoo etc. made no difference.<br>
<br>
5) Exfoliating: she had a rough glove thing and used the non perfumed stuff I mentioned, literally nearly taking a layer of skin off with that thing did nothing either except make her raw and grumpyJ.<br>
<br>
6) E45 Cream: I long held the believe that this was simply a case of blocked pores, so keeping them open and not blocking them up should be the key. This stuff sounded then ideal because you put it on a while before the sun cream and it’s supposed to open your pores. He presto right! No blocked pores after you put on your sun cream! Yup you guessed it, no workie and I really had my money on that one.<br>
<br>
7) Bare Minerals Sun Block: So my wife uses “Bare Minerals” products for her skin and she has very soft delicate skin I guess you could say. So anyway she swears by their gear and loves their products. So she came across this makeup based powdered sun block and decided to give it a go, I suppose it was mainly to be used on the face but again, it seemed to totally make sense, if it was the creams blocking up the pores, surely this was the perfect solution. Nope, if anything she was worse after it.<br>
<br>
So as we entered the final few days of the holiday, she was pretty down about it because in my mind, she really, really had tried pretty much everything this year and so it wasn’t until I was reading something on a web page that made me think. It mentioned how people who suffer from prickly heat or heat rash can have 3 times more of a bacterial called Staphylococcus epidermidis on their skin than those that don’t. We all have this, just seems people who get the rash have more. As it happened, we had a bar of Dettol soap, antibacterial soap with us. One of the many weapons in her arsenal and it occurred to me, if these bacteria could be part of the problem, could using the soap in heavy quantities help? So she tried this, lathering herself head to foot in heaps of the Dettol soap, I mean really pilling it on now before we put the sun cream on and headed out into the sun and low and behold, that evening when we got back to the room, no flare up. The second day did the same thing and that evening, npo flare up and the prickly heat from the rest of the week was nearly gone. Unfortunately, that was the last day of sun on the holiday and we had to head home the next day but we were pretty convinced that we had found the solution.<br>
<br>
I should just mention that my wife focused primarily on prevention and we didn’t pay too much attention to treatment because at that stage, you are just peeing against the wind. So just in terms of treatment from earlier in the holiday, the Hydrocortisone Cream did nothing for her but she found the calamine lotion excellent for taking down the prickly heat rash in a matter of hours instead of days.<br>
<br>
So there you go, solution, at least for my wife for the prevention of Prickly Heat Rash is simply:<br>
<br>
Heavy Lathering of Antibacterial Soap in the shower before applying hypoallergenic sun cream and I think the antihistamine tablets and non perfumed toiletries might be no harm either.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps someone else!</p>

		<p>One of my friends told me about a product from Holland and Barrett and it worked for me! It's called Quercetin (I think that's how you spell it) it was about £10/£11 and I took 2 capsules a day, a week before I went and whilst I was on holiday. (Bit like hirse pills mind you, quite large!) It worked for me, it worked for her husband. Maybe worth a try? Also make sure you don't spray any perfumes directly on your skin where you know you are likely to get prickly heat. Some said above wrists etc mine is usually my chest. Hope it helps some one else!</p>

		<p>My friends and I have found much greater sun tolerance, and reduction in prickly heat, by using a tan accelerator 2 weeks before holidays or just by replacing body lotion in spring/summer.</p>

		<p>@ Samanta - I wonder perhaps if this is urticaria? I'm not an expert on the condition but as you mention coffee (could be the drinking rather than the holding!) it might be worth looking into: http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Nettle-rash/Pages/Introduction.aspx<br>
<br>
@Omar - I agree, it's frustrating but hard to find a cure as it is caused by sweat. But I do think water sprays are a good way to help with this - you can't shower constantly but at least you can keep the areas fresh, cool and clear of any sweat build up. I hope it's helped a little! <br>
<br>
@Rebecca thanks so much for your comment and I agree wholeheartedly with all your product recommendations! But please please don't use sunbeds to prep your skin - there are safer ways and it's not worth the risk. Look into something like Imedeen supplements, I've heard nothing but good things about them in 'prepping' skin for holidays: http://www.imedeen.co.uk/products/beauty-perfection/sun-preparation</p>

		<p>I've suffered with prickly heat since being young, over the years it has got progressively worse and really ruins a holiday! I have tried so many different products and there is nothing that will stop the rashes, luckily though I have finally found a routine and arsenal of products that keep it to a minimum. I take anti-histamines 3 weeks before I go away, these are prescribed by my GP. I also take HelioCare Ultra-D tablets alongside these (they increase the skins tolerance to the sun). I also use the sunbed 3 weeks before I go. Twice a week for 3mins to build up my resistance. When i'm away I use Piz Buin Allergy SPF 30. I started using this after reading it on a forum and it worked a treat. I have used P20 but had the worst break of prickly heat with this. Also avoid waterproof suncreams as they contain wax derivitives which sit on the skin and clog your pores! Dipping in the pool or cold showers through the day help me to stay cool but I always use MagiCool Plus Prickly heat, perfect if you are out and about on day trips. I wash with Dettol Antibacterial Sensitive soap which is unperfumed and doesn't irritate my skin. I then use Piz Buin Allergy Aftersun. If worse comes to worse and I do break out in a rash Benadryl Allergy Relief cream stops the itchiness and really reduces the ugly red inflammation I get. This sounds like a lot of products which were often told to avoid using, but it has helped me so much. It keeps the prickly heat at bay a lot longer, If I do break out the its very minimal. I'd love to say it stops prickly heat completely but I don't think anything does. Hope it helps!</p>

		<p>Good read and thanks for the tips.<br>
What is really disappointing is wherever i look up heat rash treatments its never an actual, ultimate remedy / cure, all i get is advice on "avoiding" hot conditions.  Which in my case is worse because i live in jot, humid country plus i recently started working out at the gym and my rash gets really irritating when i cardio.  Really a let-down, ive been on antihistamine for about 20 days now but to no avail.  Still looking forward for an actual cure.  <br>
I also wanted to add a couple of tips since its not mentioned here, stop smoking if you are a smoker and lose weight if you are overweight.  Hopefully this will help.</p>

		<p>I find that using Elemis Tan Accelerator (amazing product!) really helps this from developing as well as Riemanns' P20. An old colleague recommended P20 before a trip to Corfu years ago so I used it every day, once a day, and only in the last day or two did any bumps start coming up and it was incredibly hot. I also avoid any tan oils as that makes it come up instantly.</p>
