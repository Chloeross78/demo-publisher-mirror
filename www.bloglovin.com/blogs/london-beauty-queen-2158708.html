              Every girl wants to be a Queen for a day. This is my little way of making that happen. I adore wearing lipstick, dressing up in ridiculous heels, bopping along to music with a beer in hand, traveling to the world&#039;s hottest cities and generally making the most of being young. (Well, sort of... I&#039;m now in the &#039;over 30s&#039; tick box.) Join me along the way as I undertake the never-ending journey to self-discovery and self-indulgence.

getting quite into my outfit posts. When I first started it was an odd sensation, standing in the middle of the street letting someone snap your photo and not really knowing where to look, but over the last few weeks I\u0027ve definitely gotten into my stride - and developed my standard poses! It helps when you think that you\u0027re never going to see any of those curious faces again, that the streets of London are often so full of obscure goings on that a generic looking woman having her picture taken is really not going to stand out as the most memorable thing of the day. My outfits have been received so well, and you guys have been so positive, that it\u0027s definitely worth that slightly awkward hour in the street. So here\u0027s another!  THE EVENTMyself and a few other bloggers have started to meet up every couple of weeks to catch up, discuss work plans, brainstorm and generally get inspo to keep us tied over for the following days. It\u0027s such a good way to keep your mojo strong and to connect with like-minded people (often bloggers are operating so solo that you can easily end up isolated, frustrated or lacking motivation,) which we tie in with a tasty brunch and even a couple of meetings. Right now the second floor cafe in Fenwicks is our fave hangout, not only because of the tasty food and super accommodating staff who let us take over a booth for a day, but because you can always celeb spot: last time we had lunch across the way from Joan Collins! These shots were taken a stone\u0027s throw away from New Bond Street, where there are so many beautiful old fashioned buildings and flowers blooming as we step into spring. A few doors down is the iconic Claridges, so I was in pretty good company for the afternoon - and the decor even matched my outfit!  THE OUTFITI have to admit this entire look has been re-hashed from things I\u0027ve had in my wardrobe for an age and completely forgotten about; isn\u0027t that the best feeling, when you rediscover something and repurpose it into a brand new look?\u00a0 The skirt is Topshop, bought a couple of years ago, and is equally great with a t-shirt in the summer as with tights and a jumper in the winter; because it\u0027s very volumous and made of a thick sweater-like material, it keeps you warm but also keeps you cool too. The jumper is a cheapo number from Primark, but the crop styles work so well with skirts (I hate having to tuck things in) that it\u0027s worth trawling through their displays to find a gem, while the shoes are last year\u0027s ASOS. I bought these sparkly loafers after falling in love with them online, but when I first started to wear them they ripped my feet to shreds: I\u0027d have to strategically plan where I was going and how much I was working if I wanted to wear them, as they were so blooming uncomfortable. However, when I rediscovered them at the bottom of my shoe basket this year they\u0027d mysteriously become super comfy; I\u0027ll never understand the magic that means uncomfortable shoes miraculously become worn in without you even realising. My fave addition to any outfit though is my trusty Oasis leather jacket, which goes with absolutely everything. I adore the material, it\u0027s oh so comfy, plus it only gets better with age; it softens a super structured outfit, funks up a girlie look or makes your jeans-and-tee combo always seem more interesting. Personally I love putting it with a slightly more \u0027office appropriate\u0027 combo to relax the overall effect, while keeping me warm and covered up. You just can\u0027t go wrong with a leather jacket can you?  THE ACCESSORIESMy current fave bag, the Givenchy Antigona, has been making numerous appearances since I picked it up in Bicester Village for a third off.\u00a0 It\u0027s such a great size (it fits in all my stuff - including a camera, my book and a makeup bag) without feeling like I\u0027m carrying around a suitcase; I\u0027ve only had it a month or so but it\u0027s the best investment I\u0027ve made in a long time. Even better is that it matches my leather jacket perfectly! In addition to the bag, a great pair of sunnies helps to keep a look casual whilst phasing you into the new season; right now there\u0027s a lot of sun even when it\u0027s still chilly, so a simple pair of black sunglasses is an essential in my Givenchy. This pair are an ASOS bargain at only \u00a314.00, but look a lot more expensive thanks to the high-fashion brow bar. On my wrists are also my current favourite things: two rose gold engraved bracelets bought for me by my fianc\u00e9. The first rectangular bracelet is engraved with the date we met and is from Beaverbrooks, the double bracelet detail making it a little different and making a subtle statement. I didn\u0027t know that Beaverbrooks engraved, but they have a whole range of jewellery that can be personalised for free - so if you fancy it it\u0027s well worth a look. The second bracelet is engraved with our initials and was bought from Not On The High Street as my Valentines gift, which matches perfectly with the one I got for my birthday a few months prior. I\u0027ve never been super fussed about expensive jewellery, but I do adore pieces that are personalised and mean something - both of these are just the ticket! Finally, another beautiful number from Henry London who is fast becoming my favourite watch brand. This dark grey strap is great for this time of year, when you want something dark without opting for black, while the rose gold detailing is refreshingly a perfect match for all my current most loved jewellery. They have a huge selection of styles and colours, all beautifully crafted to provide something you\u0027ll cherish for years to come (or change up every season if you\u0027re a bit of a watch fiend!) Make sure you check them out online.\u00a0  I hope you like my look! What\u0027s your fave piece from what I\u0027m wearing?

As strange as that sounds, I\u0027m incredibly excited for Josh and I to enter this next chapter of our lives together and to see what the next few decades have in store. To all of you that have expressed your congratulations and left kind comments, thank you; it means a great deal and has made this period even more special for us. As a moment in time many of us look to as a memory to be cherished forever, an engagement in reality is quite strange and surreal: here I am with a ring on my finger, a pile of brochures and an email addressed to a registrar, but it doesn\u0027t quite seem like I\u0027m looking towards one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. Right now it feels like I\u0027ve simply got a big old sparkler on my hand and I\u0027m having fun organising an almighty party for our loved ones. We\u0027ve cracked open the champagne and told the tale oodles of times, I\u0027ve shared snaps on my Instagram account and we\u0027ve received so many lovely cards and gifts, so I thought it was about time I shared my story here - both as a way to remember it for years to come and to let you into an area of my life that\u0027s set to become all consuming in the following months. So here it is...  PICKING THE RINGChoosing a ring that will adorn your hand for the rest of your days is a daunting task for anybody, especially for a guy who doesn\u0027t understand the first thing about jewellery. Although many women dream about their perfect dress or the ultimate cake, for me it\u0027s always been about the ring; for a long time (before I even met Josh) I\u0027ve known exactly the kind of thing I wanted, which was cemented a few years ago when I took a trip to Amsterdam\u0027s Diamond Museum with a girlfriend. As we were the only two in the store the shop assistant insisted that we both try on everything in sight; my preference has always been a princess cut halo diamond, and that was undoubtedly the style that seemed to suit my hand best. When it came to choosing a ring, we\u0027d spoken about getting married so many times before (and googled endless pictures for reference) that Josh knew the kind of direction to go in. However, with thousands of options to choose from it\u0027s no surprise that he got in a bit of a muddle and asked for help. My personal belief has always been that I\u0027d prefer to be involved in the decision making process to ensure I had something I utterly adored, rather than chance him coming under a huge amount of pressure and picking something less than perfect. So we went shopping... It was never our intention to go out for a first look and come back with a chosen (albeit yet to be purchased) ring, but that\u0027s what happened. Originally I wanted a bespoke ring made for me to my exact requirements, but the timescale and faff involved started to put me off. Having tried every single ring in one particular retailer, I knew what what suited my hand and what was utterly out of the question. What\u0027s interesting and important to know is that some rings just don\u0027t look right on your hand, whether they\u0027re too big\/too flat\/too dull, so you have to try them all to get a clearer understanding of what works. (I thought I wanted a piece of mega bling, but when I put on a certain ring Josh\u0027s exact words were \u0022it looks like it came out of a Christmas cracker.\u0022 It was so big and so sparkly that it ended up looking like a piece of cosmetic jewellery; not ideal.) I\u0027m a firm believer in fate (cemented by the way we met, which you can read about if you\u0027re interested here,) and my ring and I were meant to be. It was the last ring I tried on in the last shop - and I wasn\u0027t even intending to go in, but thought I\u0027d tick it off just to make sure I\u0027d covered all bases. It wasn\u0027t even one I\u0027d chosen myself, but it recommended by the sales assistant who popped it on my finger to try; it was the perfect style, the perfect fit, the perfect size, the perfect sparkle and even had 20% off as a special promotion. Instantly I got goosepimples and knew it was the one (and Josh was just pretty happy he\u0027d be saving 20%.) That was it! THE PROPOSALA few months after we chose the ring (and Josh secretly bought it) came the exciting part... Our first \u0027proper\u0027 date was on the London Eye, where we watched the sun set over the landscape and took in the incredible views. On the evening we got engaged, Josh had booked a restaurant that overlooked the Thames and the Eye (a special significance that I didn\u0027t realise until later.) There\u0027s no major story here and I don\u0027t want to go into the super personal details, but suffice to say we had a lovely evening - but the ring was yet to make an appearance. It wasn\u0027t until we got home that I knew something was up when Josh started to be soppier and more reflective than usual, eventually blindfolding me so he could get the gigantic ring box from out of his hiding place. In reference to our favourite film, \u0027Back To The Future\u0027 Josh nervously asked me if I\u0027d be his \u0027partner in time\u0027 while I (think) I grinned from ear to ear. After he finally got down on his knees to ask the question properly, I realised the size of the box was so gigantic that there was no way he could\u0027ve hidden that in his jeans or coat pocket (a major flaw Mr Jeweller!) I\u0027d always had the perception that rings come in little tiny boxes that can easily be concealed, but this one was so big it was about as subtle as a box of cereal. Hearing the words \u0027will you marry me\u0027 is such an odd and emotional experience and I reacted by bursting into tears and flinging my arms around Josh; he reacted by not even knowing which finger he should be putting it on! Men. WEDDING PLANNING\u00a0So here we are. We\u0027re looking forward to the next few months as we plan our Big Day and enjoy all the trappings that come with it. We\u0027ve got a date, a venue and a plan of action (as well as a tonne of Pinterest boards) so I\u0027m going to thoroughly immerse myself in the process and enjoy every moment. The last couple of weeks have been spent googling, pinning and mentally scrapbooking and I think we both now know exactly what we want; being on the same page and having the same expectations certainly makes things easier, as there are no big decisions to make. Over the next six months or so I\u0027ll undoubtedly be sharing snippets and advice I learn, as well as bits and bobs after the big event; I want to be able to document the whole experience for not only ourselves, but for our future generations too. Having been looking all over the internet for advice and words of wisdom (of which too much is fluff and not enough practical suggestion,) I also want to be able to hopefully help any future brides reading this and reassure you that there\u0027s no need to stress or worry. Although getting married is a complicated business (and so much of it relies on confirming only a few details,) it\u0027s fun and hopefully a once-in-a-lifetime thing that should be cherished. Here\u0027s to a new chapter, a whole new bundle of content and to spending lots of money on a tonne of stuff we probably don\u0027t need...

There\u0027s something nostalgic and incredibly comforting about the scent of our favourite childhood confectionery, especially as our sense of smell has been proven to be a powerful force in the formation of memory and emotion. For me there\u0027s nothing more comforting than the subtle scent of Palma Violets or breathing in the aroma of a Lemon Bon Bon, which is why I\u0027m a little obsessed with Patisserie De Bain and all the sweet body treats they have on offer. (I even named their hand creams my \u0027product of the week\u0027 back in 2015!) Not only are their formulations a pleasure to use, but they\u0027ve managed to capture everything we love about candy shops without presenting a range that airs on the side of childish and sickly sweet; it\u0027s a grown up way to celebrate our love for all things sugary - but without the calories!  I\u0027m a big fan of their hand creams already, but this March they\u0027re releasing a brand new fragrance that has got me all in a tizz: Rhubarb \u0026 Custard. The scent of the classic little boiled sweets has been bottled and magically injected into a nourishing hand cream, so you can treat your hands to a pampering while simultaneously invigorating your senses. You can\u0027t apply this without a smile creeping across your face - especially as the magicians at Patisserie De Bain have managed to get the fragrance absolutely spot on. This could have ended up sugary sweet and a little overpowering, but in fact it has a scent that\u0027s practically indistinguishable from the real thing! The cream itself is really nourishing and creamy while still absorbing really fast to leave a silky soft finish; I love the fact I can use it while working and not have creamy fingerprints all over my laptop, or pop it on mid conversation and not have to massage my hands for ten minutes to get it all to sink in. (Within five seconds it\u0027s gone, just leaving soft hands behind in its place.) Patisserie De Bain have nailed this new scent and I know that you guys will love it as much as me. It\u0027s the perfect desk-side essential or handbag treat, giving you a little sugary pick-me-up for body and mind when you need it most. All that and it\u0027s still only \u00a33.99 a tube - bargain! Will you be picking one up when it launches in the next few days?  The Patisserie De Bain hand creams are available now via Superdrug, priced \u00a33.99. The new Rhubarb \u0026 Custard scent will land this March.

It\u0027s become a destination in its own right because of the purity of the colour scheme and the quality of the items within, but until now they\u0027ve kept their focus very much to homewares. I was surprised to find out that the founder of The White Company was originally a beauty journalist and therefore incredibly passionate about skincare, so it makes complete sense that this year the brand are trying their hand at launching a capsule range of beauty products that very much fit within their ethos of minimalistic and aspirational shopping. Rather interestingly they\u0027ve partnered with Deciem (who really know their stuff - they\u0027re the people behind The Ordinary, Niod, Hylamide, Fountain and Hand Chemistry) to bring this collection to life; if you want the industry to stand up and take notice, then these are undoubtedly the guys you\u0027d turn to for help. Using their expertise to develop a collection that consists of a cleansing balm, night oil, moisturiser, concentrated serum and eye treatment, the result is a five piece line-up that provides a great basis for any skincare regime. But is it worth the hype, and more importantly the price?  The stripped back approach to skincare they\u0027ve developed matches the brand aesthetic completely,\u00a0 remaining in-keeping with their approach to everything from candles to bed throws. There\u0027s no fluff or faff, just a range of easy-to-use and incredibly beautiful formulas that will undoubtedly appeal to The White Company customers old and new; even the packaging is simple, elegant and timeless - ensuring that this appeals as much to a 25 year old as a 65 year old. Although the capsule collection is somewhat refreshing, it does mean if you want a more bespoke skincare regime or have specific needs that you\u0027ll need to look elsewhere - or at least add in a product or two from perhaps the standalone Deciem ranges. Let\u0027s take a closer look at each in turn... SUPER SERUM \u00a340.00 Featuring a blend of grape vine stem cells, protein-rich amino acids, green-tea and marine extracts, this intelligent serum offers protection against UV damage and ageing while also helping it to look plumper, smoother and more even. This is probably my favourite from the range, as it\u0027s incredibly light and more like an oil than a serum; my skin soaks it up within a few seconds, leaving a pretty radiant complexion behind that\u0027s ready for my moisturiser. It\u0027s a great all-rounder for all ages, but you will need a touch more punch if you\u0027re wanting to tackle any bigger issues than \u0027I just want to look after my skin.\u0027 ADVANCED HYDRATION \u00a330.00  Blended with an advanced form of hyaluronic acid, nourishing Amazonian oils and soothing aloe-vera butter, this lightweight moisturiser is non-greasy and absorbs quickly to leave skin feeling hydrated and comfortable. It\u0027s delicately scented with lavender, rose and orange essential oils to make the experience evocative (although the lavender puts me to sleep a little!) and luxurious, but despite that it\u0027s a relatively standard moisturiser. In my opinion the price is a little steep considering the amount of product you get, and the downside is that I\u0027m a little disappointed there\u0027s no dressing-table appropriate pot. EYE REVIVE \u00a320.00 This ultra-light gel formula claims to diminish the appearance of dark circles, visibly reduce puffiness and helps to lift the upper eyelids. It\u0027s definitely cooling and pleasurable to apply, and thanks to a blend of Persian silk tree, oxygen-boosting actives and probiotic technology there\u0027s the possibility that it could actually brighten over time too - but again, it doesn\u0027t provide the immediate difference I look for and it\u0027s not amazing enough for me to stick with over a longer period of time.\u00a0 SUPER BALM \u00a325.00 A cleansing balm that\u0027s designed to deeply, yet gently, cleanse and dissolve all traces of make-up while instantly boosting hydration, this is a great staple for anyone that needs a good cleanser at the end of a long day. It starts as a cream, melts into a lightweight balm upon contact with the skin, and then emulsifies when mixed with water to leave a creamy cleanse behind. You get a lot of product for your money too, making this a relatively affordable and effective option that I wouldn\u0027t think twice about recommending. NIGHT OIL \u00a330.00 Formulated with an enriching blend of Amazonian oils, anti-oxidants and poppy-flower extract to ensure that you\u0027ll awake with deeply nourished, super soft and firmer-looking skin, this night oil smells delicious and is a great texture for those nervous about applying oils. Although it\u0027s certainly pleasurable, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything groundbreaking going on here so you\u0027ll definitely be investing in more of a sensorial experience rather than hardcore skincare - but if that\u0027s your bag, you\u0027ll love it.\u00a0 Overall the range is great to use and provides a simple approach to skincare, but it\u0027s not rocking my world. I feel like you\u0027re definitely paying a premium for it being in White Company packaging, rather than for what\u0027s inside; my main concern with this range is the fact that partnering with Deciem means that you can get the same level of expertise and quality of ingredient from them directly - for a much cheaper price point. (The Ordinary starts at only a fiver, and if you know how to use it the range will be a life changer.) It\u0027s the perfect addition for the usual customer that pops into The White Company for a bathrobe or Christening gift and I completely understand why they\u0027ve made this brand extension, but for those of us that expect great things from their skincare product it may be worth investing your cash elsewhere. (Or just picking up a load of Deciem instead.) What do you think about The White Company\u0027s skincare range? A great addition, or a waste of money?  The White Company skincare collection ranges from \u00a320.00-\u00a340.00 and is available in stores and online. (What confuses me a little is that it\u0027s also available from Selfridges here!)

Having a healthy, radiant, powerful pout can mean the difference between feeling on top of the world and feeling like you\u0027d rather stay in bed - that\u0027s why we\u0027re collectively so obsessed with the power of a great red lipstick! However, it\u0027s easy to become complacent when it comes to your lips (and neglect them in favour of anything from your under-eye circles to your cuticles,) as we don\u0027t often notice there\u0027s an issue until its too late. Whether that\u0027s dryness, irritation, lack of plumpness (or god forbid a coldsore!) by the time our bodies tell us somethings up we\u0027re forced to go into full-on war room mode; so what if there were things you could do to make a long-term difference, ensuring your pout was always preened and perfect? Here are five of my top tips to ensure your lips are healthy and kissable all year long.  APPLY LIPIVIR TO PREVENT COLD SORES\u00a0I\u0027ve experienced my fair share of cold sores over the years and they\u0027re never fun. Once they\u0027ve appeared they leave your lips uncomfortable, sore, crusty and visually a little bit bleugh - and most importantly, they prevent you from applying the products you want to use. Cold sores can zap your confidence and leave you wanting to hide away, but thankfully lipivir have created something to help. Applying a small amount around the edge of lips both morning and night can help prevent the appearance of cold sores, even up to that first tingle. The HSV1 virus that causes cold sores reactivates by sending signals between particles to \u2018wake-up\u2019 and start replicating so they can spread; lipivir has a special formulation that disrupts these signals so they don\u2019t arrive. lts special formula is made of different polymers of ethylene glycol (a biologically\u00a0inactive substance which interferes with the signals) \u2018jamming\u2019 the viruses\u2019 communications and preventing outbreaks. Clever eh? Pop it by your toothbrush so you remember to apply every time you brush your teeth!\u00a0 USE A SOOTHING LIP BALM\u00a0Many of the lipglosses and lipsticks we use are enriched with ingredients that can irritate or dry out the surface of lips; if you\u0027ve ever applied a red lipstick multiple times in one day, you\u0027ll be very familiar with the sensation! Investing in a great lip balm that will help replenish lost moisture and inject goodness into the skin (through ingredients such as Vitamin E, coconut oil, beeswax or shea butter) will ensure you\u0027ve always got a helping hand at your side. Pop one in your bag and on your desk so you can top up throughout the day.\u00a0 BUFF THOSE LIPS ONCE A WEEK\u00a0Exfoliating away a build-up of dry and dead skin cells will help rejuvinate the skin beneath, while encouraging blood to rise to the surface (providing a more youthful and plump appearance.) Whether you want to make your own scrub with a touch of sugar and coconut oil, or opt for a shop-bought version, make sure you buff the formula gently over lips once a week (or after you\u0027ve been wearing lipstick) to leave your pout feeling fresh and smooth. Finish off with a dab of balm too soothe.\u00a0 TREAT \u0026 PAMPER OVERNIGHT\u00a0Just like with our skin, our lips can benefit from a little overnight pampering. While our bodies are in \u0027go slow\u0027 mode they can focus more on repair, putting products to work effectively so you awake rejuvinated. Apply either a thick layer of your usual lip balm or moisturiser before bed, so it can work to soothe and hydrate as you slumber; if you\u0027re a regular lipstick wearer then this is also the perfect way to ensure your lips are always the perfect blank canvas ready to be painted. INVEST IN A HUMIDIFIER\u00a0\u00a0Rather surprisingly, dry air can also dry out your lips - especially in the winter when the air can be dryer and our lips are exposed to cold winds. Investing in a humidifier to place in rooms where you spend a lot of time (such as your living room or bedroom) will help to infuse more moisture into the air; popping it on while you sleep will boost the performance of your products, while ensuring the delicate top layers are plumped full of moisture. I\u0027ve had one of these in my bedroom for around a year and it\u0027s definitely helped prevent dryness and left my skin feeling fab. Although it\u0027s a little late for resolutions, I\u0027m definitely going to try and treat my lips a little kinder throughout 2017. One of my best friends suffers from horrendous cold sores and self confidence issues when they erupt, so I\u0027m passing on my tips (along with a few tubes of lipivir) to see if it helps. Nobody should have to suffer with dry, irritated or sore lips - but luckily help is at hand!

Historically skincare has always been the dull side of the beauty industry, with the focus very much being on game-changing makeup or instantly transformative haircare, but over the last decade our opinions have been transformed. As we collectively seek out ways to ensure our complexion remains radiant, healthy and strong throughout our lives (and the focus very much being on keeping those signs of ageing at bay for as long as possible,) skincare provides the tools we need to make a difference. Previous generations may have relied on soap, water and a little pot of cold cream, but now we\u2019re turning to the most advanced science we can find - and integrating upwards of eight steps into our morning regime. Like with anything us consumers can get our hands on, the assumption is that \u2018you get what you pay for\u2019 and we should all be turning to super expensive lotions and skipping the budget potions altogether. However, if you know what to look for and how to shop your product portfolio doesn\u2019t have to set you back the price of a designer handbag.  Own brand skincare has always had a bit of a reputation for being naff, ineffective and something you\u2019d rather hide away in your bathroom; often the design of the packaging, marketing and information behind it doesn\u2019t exactly help either. When presented with a relatively plain looking pack versus a super luxurious pot, which would you rather choose? However, often own branded skincare has been developed with the same science and within the same labs as some of the most expensive and aspirational brands - you just don\u2019t pay the premium for that brand name and fancy pot. Unless a brand is part of a huge conglomerate, they tend to outsource their product development to other companies and utilise existing technology to develop the next \u2018groundbreaking\u2019 serum or face cream. (In fact Boots have a huge UK plant where they develop too many of the high street names to mention; you\u2019d never know it was essentially all the same stuff unless you knew where to look!) What\u2019s interesting (and rather exciting) is that some of the \u2018own brand\u2019 skincare is therefore just as good as stuff that will set you back three times the price, because it\u2019s developed in the same labs by the same people and often even produced in the same factories. The difference is that because that brand doesn\u2019t have to pay themselves up to a 60% margin for the privilege of being sold in their stores (Boots\/Superdrug\/Tesco etc all buy in products at an average of 40% of the retail price, allowing themselves a tidy profit,) they can focus on creating the best product while keeping the price point down. That\u2019s why Boots No7 is clinically proven to be so effective, but remains incredibly affordable; similarly, that\u2019s why Superdrug\u2019s own brand skincare is receiving increasing industry praise while often costing less than a tenner. Even brands including Avon and M\u0026S have some beautiful products that really make a difference to skin, but you may never think to turn to them because of the perception you may have. Like it\u2019s become socially acceptable to hunt out a bargain or admit to buying that stellar dress from Matalan, the perception of own brand skincare is starting to change - which is great for both our complexions and our purses. If you look past the brand name and the (usually) rather dull packaging, you may find yourself a little gem that works just as hard as something super premium. Need a place to start during your weekend shop? Here are some of my personal fave affordable and effective skincare own brand products. Boots No7 Protect \u0026 Perfect Advanced Serum (\u00a332.95)  Clinically proven to reduce the signs of ageing, these products were truly groundbreaking when they first launched and caused a stampede of women to form in stores nationwide after being featured on TV. They\u2019re pleasurable to use, have been formulated for different age ranges and don\u2019t cost you an arm and a leg.  Superdrug \u2018B\u2019 Radiant\/Nourished Day Cream (\u00a310.99)\u00a0 Another great range that\u0027s clinically proven to deliver results in only four weeks, this day cream is light enough to apply under makeup while still providing the hydration skin needs. Both my Mum and Nan but this range to the test a couple of years ago and loved everything about it; they genuinely thought it had made a difference to their skin and assumed it was some super-dooper expensive brand. (They tried it blind for four weeks. See the results in my post here!)  Anew Ultimate Supreme Dual Elixir (\u00a320.00)\u00a0 Combining the power of two individual formulas in one pump (both an oil and serum,) this formula includes black pearls and gold peptides to help purify skin cells, provide a protective moisture barrier and reverse the signs of ageing. It\u0027s a real pleasure to use and feels way more expensive than the \u00a320.00 price point, proving you don\u0027t have to stretch to Elizabeth Arden prices if you don\u0027t want to. M\u0026S Absolute Ultimate Sleep Cream (\u00a322.00)  One of the very few products I\u2019ve used to the very last drop, this beautifully formulated overnight treatment helps to leave skin radiant and refreshed - while tackling those signs of ageing over time.

We reveled in being able to share our loves and loathes, provide honest feedback on our purchases and discuss issues that were important to us; opinions were at the heart of the bloggersphere and absolutely what made it stand out amongst the run-of-the-mill and diluted glossiness of magazines. Collectively we had turned against mainstream media as we couldn\u0027t necessarily trust the opinions and edits presented to us, especially when big brands and mega budgets were having an increasingly negative impact on the information between the covers. Bloggers were honest, transparent and not afraid to share exactly what they thought; a week didn\u0027t go by without one of us getting a \u0027cease and desist\u0027 letter from a brand that didn\u0027t like what we had to say, and were using their legal teams to scare us into censoring opinions. It was brilliant. It was wonderful. It was a turning point in time. Not everyone loved the same things or had the same opinions on a new launch, but that was ok - because that was a reflection of what was happening in the real world.  I like to refer to this as the \u0027golden age\u0027 of blogging: before it became as glossy, edited and mainstream as the media we were rebelling against. Over the last decade the bloggersphere has evolved (both positively and negatively) to the point that it\u0027s almost unrecogniseable from where we started; the editorial style of writing, fashion magazine standard photography and beautifully curated social media feeds that make every 20-something look like their living the life of Gigi Hadid are just the tip of the iceberg. The big issue? As a veteran of the blogging world I\u0027m increasingly aware and concerned about the lack of real opinion - it\u0027s like the industry has become too scared to provide insight that\u0027s not 100% positive, or to share thoughts that aren\u0027t always \u0027on brand\u0027. You can find literally thousands of cookie cutter blogs out there, but very few of them offer insight or comment beyond \u0027I love it!\/It\u0027s so pretty!\/This is a must-have!\u0027 With the growth of the blogging community I understand that we\u0027re all in constant competition for the latest product sample, press trip or sponsored campaign (and that often playing it safe provides higher return in the short term.) I understand that brands want you to say nice things about their products, because their end objective is to make as many sales as possible. However, what I don\u0027t understand is why so many within the bloggersphere are happy to ride the safe train at the expense of their reader. In the words of Caroline Hirons during a recent post: \u0022God forbid you say you didn\u2019t get on with something. God forbid you use your platform to give your readers genuine feedback on an experience, even when it\u2019s done so constructively and without resorting to blanket negativity. Having an opinion does not make you a bitch, and it certainly should not make you ashamed.\u0022 Amen Hirons, amen. The digital space has successfully evolved into something aspirational, motivational and incredibly curated, but in my opinion this has been at the expense of raw and unedited opinion - which is why we all started in the first place. We\u0027re on very dangerous ground right now as blogs become increasingly fluffy and bland. I find myself continually fighting to be recognised as an intelligent woman with a well-rounded background and informed opinion, but when there are so many others out there focusing on the prettiness of their online space rather than what impact their words have, it becomes somewhat of a losing battle. Super styled beauty images, professionally shot outfits and hired locations that wouldn\u0027t look out of place on the pages of Vogue are great, but it\u0027s also important for us to use the power of the written (or spoken) word to make positive change or share valuable opinion. As an example, recently a new beauty concept launched into the UK under the name of \u0027Beauty Pie\u0027; this subscription platform seemed great on the surface, but when you started to scratch away and look deeper there were a number of issues and problematic areas that needed addressing as part of a comprehensive review. (You can read my full feature here.) What concerned me was the number of features that praised the service as something revolutionary and overwhelmingly positive, without letting readers know about the potential pitfalls (of which there were many.) I\u0027ve literally read hundreds of articles on the concept, but could probably count on my hands the number of sites that dared to say anything negative (or worse, even bothered to do their own research rather than just repeating what was on the press release.) Everyone is free to give their opinion and share their own thoughts (positive, negative or neutral) because that\u0027s the whole point of the bloggersphere, but when there\u0027s no opinion at all? That\u0027s when it becomes worrying. I feel incredibly uneasy about the future of blogging right now, because I think we\u0027re in serious danger of becoming as edited and vacuous as the magazines that we\u0027re supposed to be replacing. Too many are focused on whether everything is \u0027on brand\u0027 for them, rather than using their voice and influence to impart knowledge or advice; too many are worried about losing out on that next press trip or bundle of free lipsticks, rather than focusing on creating a strong persona that their readers can relate to. Too many of us are being shot down for having an opinion or told that we should just get back to talking about lipsticks, while the blogging elite are focused on their next big pay rather than whether they would genuinely recommend a product without it. I\u0027ve always made it a priority to share my true thoughts and bring you an honest account of my experiences; a great brand will understand that not everyone will adore every product, and a reader won\u0027t expect you to. Opinions are vital to the bloggersphere and how it operates, but they seem to now be as rare as a limited edition Mariah Carey lipstick. I think it\u0027s about time we brought them back... But you know, that\u0027s just my opinion. What do you think about the scarcity of opinions within the bloggersphere right now? Does it concern or worry you? Have you noticed a change over the last few years, or do the sites you follow continue to tell it how it is - no holds barred?  \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

The first few months are a bit dry when it comes to exciting launches, but all of a sudden it\u0027s like the beauty industry wakes up after a winter kip and starts delivering little nuggets of brilliance. We have to get the first few weeks out of the way, dodge the pinkness of Valentines and focus on the other side of Mother\u0027s Day before the good stuff starts happening - but already we\u0027re starting to see little trickles of sunlight. Thankfully there are hot bits landing that are worth knowing about, some launches that you\u0027ll be coveting and collections that will leave you wondering whether you can justify yet another one of those... These are the ten pieces I\u0027m excited to share with you and think you\u0027ll be wanting to add to your shopping list this weekend. You\u0027ve been warned!  Miller Harris Rose Silence Body Wash (\u00a324.00) I\u0027ve been waiting such a long time for Miller Harris to branch into bath and body care - and thankfully it was worth the wait. I adore their Rose Silence scent (I got through half a bottle within a matter of weeks when I first discovered it,) so I\u0027m thrilled I can now douse myself in it during every morning shower. The packaging is simple, as you\u0027d expect, but within is a beautifully scented wash that will just enhance the effect of the scent and provide a luxurious moment. Yes it\u0027s a lot of money for a body wash, but if we can\u0027t treat ourselves to a little pampering then what\u0027s the point in anything? DKNY Be Delicious \u0027City Girls\u0027 Fragrance (\u00a338.50)  There have been more versions of Be Delicious than I could possibly count, but this time it\u0027s the turn of illustrator Donald Robertson to create something a little different. Available in three variants, this blue \u0027Brooklyn Girl\u0027 number is definitely my fave; a little edgier and not as sweet as the others, it\u0027s undoubtedly something you could spritz all over day after day. You\u0027ll either love or hate the rather unusual and artsy designs, but don\u0027t let that put you off what\u0027s inside.  Stila Magnificent Metals Glitter \u0026 Glow Liquid Eyeshadows (\u00a323.00)\u00a0It\u0027s been so long since I really used any Stila cosmetics (I remember they used to be the coolest brand when I first started blogging, but they\u0027ve taken a bit of a hit over the years) but these liquid glitter eyeshadows are AH-MAZIN. They\u0027re incredibly pigmented and packed full of glitter, providing a really sophsiticated and slightly rocky look that\u0027s even more sexy when blended into a smokey eye. Choose from either a black or golden glitter, but both can take you from day to night with ease - I adore them. Part of a limited edition collection, if you like the sound of the result you\u0027re gonna have to act fast and snap them up before they\u0027re gone.\u00a0   The Ordinary High Silicone\/Spreadibility Liquid Primer (\u00a35.50) One of the brands I was most excited for in 2016, The Ordinary have just launched into Fenwicks and rumour has it they\u0027ll be appearing on many more high streets this year - as well as in the very first Deciem stand alone store. These two primers are seriously cheap but still seriously effective; of the two I prefer the traditional silicone primer which creates an effortless smooth finish on skin, but if you prefer your bases light and airy then the liquid primer is a great alternative. Either way, they\u0027re great primers to have in your reportoire (whether you use one every day or not.)\u00a0  Too Faced Sweet Peach Creamy Oil Lipglosses (\u00a316.00) I think I\u0027ve got a problem. I can\u0027t stop smelling these delicious little tubes of peachy goodness. Just the right side of sweet and addictive, these creamy glosses are enriched with nourishing oils to provide a comfortable yet pigmented finish; available in three shades, these are perfect for transitioning into spring. My fave is the peachy pink colour, as it adds just a hint of femininity to my look without me having to go full throttle with the cerise, but the bright oranges will be just the ticket come summer. As soon as you pop open the cap you breathe in the scent, so you may become a little too obsessed with re-applying than you should be.\u00a0  Kiehls Pure Vitality Skin Renewing Cream (\u00a343.00) Formulated with Red Ginseng Root and Manuka Honey, this claims to be able to help strengthen your skin\u0027s barrier and encourage skin renewal - the result of which should be smoother, healthier looking and more resiilent skin. Although I\u0027ve only tried it once to date, it is a pleasure to apply and actually smells a little of honey; it\u0027s relatively lightweight but instantly nourishes, leaving skin feeling plump and hydrated. Sometimes you just need the most basic of moisturiser to do the job, but if you want to skip all the other steps in your regime an enriched and hardworking product like this is always a great idea. I\u0027ll report back in a few weeks when I\u0027ve used it more thoroughly!\u00a0  Jo Malone 50ml Velvet \u0026 Rose Oud Fragrance (\u00a374.00) Just when I think I\u0027ve found my favourite Jo Malone scent, another one comes along to take its place within my perfume hierarchy. This is a deliciously romantic and rich scent that\u0027s perfect for this time of year - when you want to wear something a little fresher and more floral, but don\u0027t want to leave behind the deeper smokey notes of winter just yet. Although this is a beautiful fragrance, the news is actually that Jo Malone are now offering their \u0027Intense\u0027 fragrances in 50ml bottles (which does make them a touch more affordable.) They\u0027re cute in size, practical in nature and kinder on the purse.  Garnier Micellar Cleansing Gel Wash (\u00a33.99)\u00a0 Micellar waters are nothing new (I got bored of them a long time ago,) but this cleansing gel wash embraces the same technology to gently help rid the skin of dirt and grime. Although it\u0027s never going to offer the same benefits as a thorough cleanse, this is a great little tool to have in your shower for a morning wash - or even to leave by the sink as a second cleanse. It doesn\u0027t strip skin or leave it feeling tight, but just helps to thoroughly remove traces of makeup and grime that have been left behind. Tropic Skincare Good Skin Day Resurfacing Serum (\u00a342.00)\u00a0 Sweet as candy, this little bottle contains a lot of goodness to help restore skin\u0027s radiance - either as a day serum that can be worn under makeup, or an overnight treatment. The formula includes lime pearl extract, glycolic acids and willow bark BHA exfoliate for a smoother skin surface, papaya enzymes and AHA fruit complexes to refine and tighten pores, plus a concentrated formula of hyaluronic acid to deliver a boost of skin hydration. Used daily, it will help to slough away the dull surface of skin and leave a radiant and smoother finish behind instead; formulated with tonnes of naturally sourced ingredients, this has definitely left my skin looking and feeling brighter already.  Aveeno After-Shower Mist (\u00a37.50) I\u0027m all about the spray body lotions nowadays, as they help to moisturise my skin without leaving it feeling clammy. I can\u0027t be dealing with sticky tights or hanging around waiting for creams to fully absorb - this girls got sh*t to be getting on with. This super lightweight version from Aveeno has been specially formulated to be used just after you step out of the shower, helping to lock in moisture and replenish any that\u0027s been lost during your morning scrub. Although it\u0027s actually really just a good marketing story (you can use this any time, you little rebel!) the product is like a very nourishing water spray; it\u0027s transparent in colour and absorbs incredibly quickly, even mixing with those last droplets of water on your skin to leave a smooth and comfortable surface. I like it a lot.  Have you got your eye on any of my ten current faves?

The original was released back in 1991 when I was barely nine years old, but I can still remember the songs practically word-for-world and continue to dream of having a dress as beautiful (and yellow) as Belle\u0027s in that classic scene; there\u0027s something about the emotion that\u0027s attached to such a tale that still puts a smile on my face. Skip forward over 25 years and this iconic story is about to get a new lease of live via the live action version, starring our very own Hermoine Granger. (My inner Potter-nerd is probably happier about that than it should be.) It\u0027s not even due to hit cinemas for another month, but the merchandise has already started to go into overdrive to tickle our tastebuds and get us in the mood for the big event. Although I may be too old for plastic dolls and princess dresses, I\u0027m definitely not past the stage of wanting a piece of Beauty and the Beast lipstick - so when I discovered that L\u0027Oreal were launching a 14-piece collection to celebrate the launch, I almost peed myself with excitement. The only downside is that it\u0027s exclusively available in Italy, but thanks to an Amazon Prime account I was able to buy it and ship the collection over in a couple of days! Hoorah!  First things first: the collection includes seven lipsticks and seven coordinating nail polishes, which together set me back around \u00a390.00. That works out about \u00a36.40 each, with the bonus that they\u0027re all packed in a special edition keepsake box; they\u0027re not cheap, but together it\u0027s not insanely expensive if you\u0027re obsessed with the film franchise or just simply want a piece of makeup history. Each of the main characters each have their own lipstick and polish (including Belle, Beast, Mrs Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere, the featherduster and the rose) which are adorned with designs that correspond to their character. Unfortunately the designs aren\u0027t printed onto the packaging itself, but instead are stickers that have been applied over the top; I can only assume that this is why the range hasn\u0027t been brought over to the UK, as it\u0027s not the same standard we\u0027re used to seeing from L\u0027Oreal (even if the stickers are good quality and textured, as well as featuring embossed metallic touches.) Nevertheless, the overall effect is somewhat magical and definitely makes me feel like this is something to be treasured for years to come.  The collection includes a number of bold shades, including a classic red and power pink, alongside a more wearable chocolate brown and nude tone. I would\u0027ve liked to see more of a spectrum (there feels like there\u0027s a lot of red, perhaps because of the Italian market?) but they\u0027re all very wearable and universal in appeal - just like the nail polishes. (That navy blue!) Personally I don\u0027t get why the Cogsworth products aren\u0027t a beautiful brown colour, nor why there\u0027s a very random featherduster (not a main character in my opinion) and slightly tacky lipstick mark design, but the rest of the range definitely leaves me feeling pleased with my purchase. Thankfully the box everything is held in absolutely met my expectations, providing a covetable and great quality outer in which to store the makeup items within (because you know these aren\u0027t meant to be actually used!) I do wish that there were token limited edition Beauty and the Beast lipsticks and polishes available in the UK, especially because the rose version is so pretty, but alas... Maybe the fact you can\u0027t get hold of them makes it all the more lustworthy? I\u0027m definitely in the mood for a Be Our Guest marathon now, even if I can\u0027t bring myself to actually apply the polish!  What do you think of this limited edition collection? Are you a fan of Beauty \u0026 The Beast? Would you consider importing anything from overseas if you couldn\u0027t get your hands on it locally?

There are so many beauty rules and regulations set by the media (including us bloggers!) but realistically none of us will ever be able to follow them to the letter - be it time, energy, understanding or finances preventing us from doing so. Although there are certain things I would recommend either avoiding or adopting, there\u0027s also a tonne of stuff that\u0027s really not worth getting in a flap over; you\u0027re not going to ruin your body if you skip a step, forget to take off your makeup effectively or use a touch of sulphate-enriched shampoo on your head, but it is important to be aware and informed so you can choose what\u0027s right for you. Here are the eight \u0027mistakes\u0027 many of us make, and why you shouldn\u0027t get in a flap over them.  1. SKIPPING SERUM AND\/OR EYE CREAMDon\u0027t get me wrong, I love a complicated skincare regime as much as the next beauty obsessive, but sometimes it\u0027s ok to skip that extra step. I understand that adding four layers beneath your makeup can cause more problems than it helps if you don\u0027t get it right (the key is to only apply a touch and not coat your face in a light layer of goo,) so if you feel like serum or eye cream isn\u0027t for you then that\u0027s cool. Just make sure you have a regime that works for your needs.\u00a0  2. REACHING FOR A FACE WIPEYep, still hate them, but face wipes do serve a purpose: to help remove the superficial layer of dirt we see in the mirror after a long night out\/the day that felt like it was never going to end. Although they will only ever remove the top layer of makeup and offer nothing in the way of a deep cleanse, something is better than nothing. Just don\u0027t make it a regular occurrence as the alcohol can dry out skin, while the remaining grime on your face will inevitably cause breakouts.\u00a0  3. NOT DOUBLE CLEANSINGUs bloggers have got a tendency to preach about double cleansing, when in actual fact it\u0027s not right for everybody. If you wear heavy makeup and\/or SPF you should definitely be cleansing twice in the evening to ensure your complexion is squeaky clean, but if you suffer with dryness or irritation, wear only a little or no makeup, or simply have a tendency to over scrub, then a singular cleanse may be all you need. If you\u0027re prone to breakouts, acne or rosacea, then definitely stick to a gentle single cleanse.\u00a0  4. TURNING UP YOUR STRAIGHTENERSI come from the generation of women who had to turn their straighteners up to full wack to get them to do anything; but that was before GHDs and scorching temperatures that could practically sever a finger. I\u0027m sure we\u0027re all guilty of using our appliances on the hottest setting, but the most important thing is you apply a heat protection spray so you don\u0027t burn off your tresses - and that you regularly embrace putting down the tools.  5. USING TOO MUCH DRY SHAMPOODry shampoos are designed to draw out moisture from the hair and scalp, removing the \u0027lank\u0027 feeling that can often occur between washes; however, when overused they can actually remove too much moisture. (Find out more here) Despite that, dry shampoo is one of the biggest must-haves and is used so often that we can\u0027t really remember a time without it. Rather than ditching it or feeling guilty, opt for a lighter and more natural version that won\u0027t clog the hair follicles - your head will be happy, plus you can get those extra minutes in bed.  6. FORGETTING A BASE COATOne of my biggest beauty hates is that inevitable staining when you\u0027ve removed your dark nail polish; what is is about deep reds that leave a mark on your fingers for days to come? We\u0027re told we should always use a base coat in order to provide protection and help to strengthen the nail, but in my experience it really doesn\u0027t make that much difference - especially now many polishes are enriched with ingredients that are supposed to offer a base coat effect anyway. Take my advice and skip this extra step in favour of applying a top coat; at least that may help with longevity!\u00a0  7. DYING YOUR WHOLE HEAD (NOT JUST THE ROOTS)\u00a0Every single time I open a new box of hair dye, I whimper at the thought of having to apply it in a two-phased approach; it doubles the time and effort, when all I want to do is chuck it on and get rid of those greys. Although it is better for your hair to apply to the roots for the majority of the time, topping up the rest of your locks in the last few minutes, realistically you won\u0027t overly damage your barnet by chucking on more dye - especially when most of the time it\u0027s already saturated with the same colour. If your priority is those annoying greys, get on with it and then get on with your life. \u00a0  8. NOT CARING ABOUT INGREDIENTS\u00a0There\u0027s so much information online about parabens, silicones, sulphates and so on - and even more so about opting for organic or embracing the natural. Although I\u0027m a firm believer in being informed and making purchasing decisions that work for you, you\u0027re not going to die from a bottle of shampoo. (If you think you are, please stop reading the Daily Mail.) If you care passionately about what you put on and in your body, that\u0027s great - but equally if you really couldn\u0027t give a toss that\u0027s absolutely fine too.  Do you worry about any of these beauty \u0027mistakes\u0027 creeping into your daily life? Are you fed up of being made to feel like a rubbish woman because you don\u0027t use seven products on your face every morning, or because you go through a bottle of dry shampoo a fortnight?   \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

(Nothing against Wallis, just a metaphorical signal of getting old and not fitting in Zara any more!) For the past couple of months I\u0027ve been living in jeans and jumpers on rotation, which gets a bit boring after a while - especially when I only seem to buy jumpers in cream, grey or black. I\u0027ve definitely been trying to spice up my wardrobe with a few pieces that make a statement, or rediscover old favourites that I\u0027d forgotten how much I loved; the weather is so changeable right now, meaning I\u0027m never wearing the right thing, but embracing colour and texture is a great way of having fun with your outfits without jumping into spring fashion a month too early. That\u0027s what I did during an overnight stay at The Rosewood...  THE SKIRT\u00a0I\u0027ve been loving the stretchy Topshop midi-length skirts for some time now, having picked up my first nearly a year ago to transition into spring; they\u0027re effortless, but still make me feel like I\u0027m making more of an effort than I do when chucking on jeans, and the stretchy material actually means I can fit into them. Hoorah! I\u0027ve got one in mustard, nude and a very pale blue, but when I spotted one in metallic gold I practically ran to the till and chucked them my money - why is a metallic skirt so hot right now? I\u0027ve worn this a few times with a velvet tee or strappy slip during the evening, but I decided to bite the bullet and fashion it for daytime with a rather loud and proud jumper too. SEE THE SKIRT HERE THE JUMPER\u00a0I adore the colour combo of this jumper - and so does practically everyone I come into contact with when wearing it. Believe it or not, it\u0027s from New Look and is currently in the sale for only \u00a37.00 (down from the \u00a322.99 I paid; blooming typical.) It\u0027s super comfy and slightly cropped, making it perfect for pairing with a skirt or high waisted trousers if you don\u0027t want to get your belly out every time you stretch. I like the fact it\u0027s not heavy or overly thick, ensuring it\u0027s a great transitional piece for when you know it\u0027s a bit chilly but you\u0027ll probably be sweating by lunchtime. SEE THE JUMPER HERE  THE SHOESI don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m sick and tired of boots already. I have so many pairs and at the end of every season I feel like I should\u0027ve given them more outings than I did, but right now I have an unnatural urge to let my toes free and embrace slip-ons instead. These dark green velvet loafers are from Zara and definitely add a touch more colour and texture to my look, without prohibiting my ability to walk in a straight line; when I\u0027m in London comfort takes priority. I picked them up last Autumn so you\u0027ll be lucky to find them anywhere, but there are a tonne of similar ones available to help you transfer from boot back to shoe. The only issue is that they attract ALL the dust and you can never get them looking pristine again from the moment you walk outside. SEE SIMILAR SHOES HERE THE BAG\u00a0What brings an outfit all together? A rather cute, quirky and fun bag! I\u0027ve been lusting after this Anya Hindmarsh cross-body bag for blooming ages, but it\u0027s over \u00a3800 full retail price (ouch) so I couldn\u0027t justify that much simply because it was cute. Cue an impromptu visit to Biscester Village with my fianc\u00e9 (first time I\u0027ve written that - weird!) and I found this in the AH boutique for 50% off. WHOOP! I love everything about it: the super soft leather, the heavy chain strap, the little pouch on the reverse and the fact that it\u0027s big enough for everything I need (including my camera) for a day out. The googly eyes are just a bonus as it gives an otherwise standard bag a little twist that just lifts any outfit; the cream colour is totally tran-seasonal and the shape classic, so even though it\u0027s a piece from a seasonal limited edition collection I know it will age well. A worthy investment (and you can get them in other colours for a similar price online now too.) I\u0027ve used it so many times already. SEE THE BAG HERE\u00a0 An easy to wear, super comfy and practical outfit with just a sprinkling of edge. You like?\u00a0 Thanks to Kirsty from fashionforlunch.net for taking all the snaps!

Adding a powerful pout to an otherwise low key outfit can perk you up and help you to look \u0027finished\u0027, while a glide of an understated nude shade just helps to convey that feeling of effortless elegance. However, there is a downside to wearing a touch of lippie: my lips tend to become dry, uncomfortable and unable to take more than a second layer of colour. Last week I wore a fabulous Kat Von D number in a statement red shade, but after a few hours the colour had bled and my lips were feeling dryer than the dessert during a heatwave; what looks great when you step out the door doesn\u0027t always keep feeling fab when you just want to go about your business. Burt\u0027s Bees have always been a brand I\u0027ve had a lot of love for (and probably the brand I\u0027m most loyal to, simply because their lipbalms are in every pocket, drawer and handbag in my life) because their formulations are full of goodness while ensuring such a comfortable finish. They\u0027ve dabbled in colour before with the launch of their lip crayons (which I loved and wrote about here,) but this springtime they\u0027re taking that one step further with the launch of full on lipsticks in 18 covetable shades - all of which provide fabulous pigment and a super comfortable finish.  Housed in cute bee-inspired packaging, these bullets provide full coverage and vibrant colour with up to eight hours of colour (although I\u0027d like to find anyone that\u0027s able to make their lipsticks last for eight hours - maybe they don\u0027t talk or eat for a full day?!) Like the rest of the Burt\u0027s Bees range, these are 100% natural (but not organic) and are bursting with tasty ingredients including beeswax, Vitamin E, Moringa and Raspberry Seed Oils to help condition your lips all day long. What you will notice when you apply these is that they feel like a beautiful nourishing balm, not a drying lipstick; they glide over lips with ease to deposit a beautiful colour result in shades that range from the perfect pink and nudes, to the bold berry tones and classic reds. I have noticed that with the darker and more statement shades it\u0027s worth buffing your lips throroughly to remove any dry skin, as for some reason the formula can clump around dry patches and look a bit inconsistent; similarly, it\u0027s worth applying the darker tones with a lip brush rather than straight from the bullet, as they can appear a bit patchy. Although the packaging for me does cheapen the overall look and feel of the lipsticks, it is made of 100% recycled plastic and can be recycled after use too... So I suppose that outweighs the need for something super premium and aesthetically pleasing. It still does the job, and I love the little coloured honeycomb holes, but I would have liked just a touch more material to make it feel a bit sturdier. For \u00a39.99 they\u0027re a great little buy and one I know I\u0027ll be reaching for a lot when I want my colour to last without getting the fear that re-applying will dry out my lips for days. Well done Burt, you\u0027ve created another great addition to your ever expanding lip portfolio!  The Burt\u0027s Bees lipsticks are available now in 18 shades, priced \u00a39.99 each.\u00a0  \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

There\u0027s so much more to the world than the Costa Del Sol and New York City, and I want a part of it. I\u0027m fortunate enough to have the time, finances and flexibility to travel much more in my thirties than I ever have before, so I\u0027m making a concerted effort to see the world and discover as many amazing places as I can get through - starting with these five that I\u0027m just itching to fly off to.\u00a0  GIRAFFE MANOR, NAIROBI I\u0027ve always wanted to visit the beautiful African lands (maybe I\u0027ve watched The Lion King too many times) and discover my inner jungle princess, but since discovering Giraffe Manor that passion has trebled. This incredible 1930\u0027s style manor house hotel is set within a vast Nairobi landscape and oozes vintage appeal; not only are the surroundings utterly stunning, but you can actually feed the giraffes while you eat your breakfast as they pop their heads through the window for a morning snack. How amazing is that? It costs a small fortune, but I\u0027m determined to get here at some point in the not too distant future. POMPEII, ITALY\u00a0My fascination with this historic town dates back to studying it at school and seeing the incredible figures in their frozen positions; I\u0027ve watched documentary after documentary on the days leading up to the event that\u0027s forever etched in history and can\u0027t quite get my head around what it must have been like. My mum visited Pompeii a couple of years ago and was hypnotised by its story, so after seeing her pictures I\u0027ve been itching to go myself. Italy is such a beautiful country, but there\u0027s something special about this location that I simply must tick off my list.\u00a0 ST TROPEZ, SOUTH OF FRANCE\u00a0I was lucky enough to stay in St Tropez for a night a couple of years ago on a press trip (the yaughts are insane!) but 24 hours just wasn\u0027t enough to take it all in. Although the main attraction is the harbor, there are so many little back streets and cafes to discover that make this more than an overnight destination. I\u0027d love to charter a boat for a few days and sail around the coast (wishful thinking,) but in the meantime a hotel in the area and a seat on the edge of the port with a nice glass of rose wine will suffice.\u00a0  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK\u00a0The home of all things Hygge, Copenhagen has a relaxed and cosy appeal like no other city. Full of design and style inspiration, it\u0027s Instagram heaven for anyone that can appreciate the clean lines and muted colour palette - while the watery backdrop allows you to breathe in and appreciate the surroundings. Steeped in history as much as art and modern culture, this is a city I know will be super expensive but absolutely worth it. I can\u0027t wait to find an Airbnb to ensure I get the local experience too! MIAMI, FLORIDA\u00a0When we had our Florida holiday about 18 months ago we were planning to drive down to Miami and spend a day on the beach - but time got away from us and we realised we needed some down time after the intensity of the parks. (Miami is about a four hour drive from central Florida, so that\u0027s a long way to go for a day trip.) Since then I\u0027ve wondered about organising a visit back to take in the pastel architecture and incredible beaches, and right now it seems like a better idea than ever. I\u0027ve heard such great things about this part of the world, and its association with Dexter just makes it even more of a destination. (Just me?!) Where would you love to visit in 2017? Are you dreaming of any of my ultimate destinations too?  \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Us beauty bloggers have undoubtedly been fueling the trend, promising readers that the latest eyeshadow palette to land on our doorstep is a brilliant copy of something four times the price, but the market has also been driven by technological improvements that allow us to buy into the same quality for a fraction of the previous cost. When I was growing up the only \u0027budget\u0027 beauty brands were Collection 2000 and Boots 17, both offering a plethora of products to get experimental with but the quality wasn\u0027t there; as soon as we could upgrade to something a touch more glamorous, we would. Skip forward a few decades and those (rebranded) names are not only offering far superior quality and in some instances competing with some of the most luxury cosmetics available, but our high streets have been somewhat revolutionised. Names including MUA, Makeup Revolution, Lottie London, NYX, Freedom, GOSH, Miss Sporty, Model\u0027s Own and Sleek are proving that you don\u0027t have to spend a fortune to fill your makeup bag with greatness - but they\u0027re also collectively providing us with dupes of everything from Urban Decay Naked palettes and Kylie liquid lipsticks, to NARS blushers and Bobbi Brown highlighters. For a moment there we got a bit excited, but are we over it? Is 2017 the year that we\u0027re finally bored of the dupe and we start trading up for something we can treasure?  In my opinion the growth of our dupe fascination came with the rise in popularity of throwaway fashion and being able to snap up something on-trend for the price of your morning coffee. Primark allowed us to update last year\u0027s jumper with the help of a \u00a32.50 statement necklace, or pick up a pair of pumps for \u00a34.00 during our lunchbreak; we became obsessed with buying all the fashion and always having something new to adorn our bodies with, as for the first time ever fashion became insanely affordable. It became the norm to buy a new outfit for every night out, because we didn\u0027t have to break our backs to do so; it became pretty standardised to pick up a Mulberry or Chloe copy from New Look or Topshop as the high street tried to capture our attention in new and exciting ways. Unsurprisingly this filtered pretty quickly into the beauty industry, with consumers always wanting to hunt down that must-have product without having to fork out the full price. Some brands have built their entire business models off the back of dupes, even taking the time to ensure their packaging is \u0027inspired\u0027 by their more expensive counterparts. Makeup Revolution, Barry M, Sleek, W7 and The Balm are some of the worst (or best) culprits, being able to turn around a new product and offer up a dupe sometimes within a few months of the original hitting shelves. Others take a softer approach, preferring to identify trends (nude eyeshadow palettes, liquid lipsticks and finely milled pigmented blushers) and create their own take without stepping on any toes. Up until this point they\u0027ve benefited from a huge surge in consumer interest (fueled by bloggers knowing that anything considered a dupe will bring in those much needed hits!) but my gut feeling is that this is coming to an end. Although picking up a cut price item of makeup will give us a buzz, if it just doesn\u0027t perform or feel like the original would we be better off saving our pennies and splurging on products we know we\u0027ll thoroughly enjoy from beginning to end? I love brands like Makeup Revolution, but I can\u0027t help but feel like they need to step out of the dupe arena and create something new. Endless tweaks on the same product get a little dull, while a stand full of copycats makes me feel like they lack the creativity consumers are beginning to expect. Just as I\u0027ve moved away from fast fashion, I\u0027m also moving away from fast beauty; I would far prefer to spend \u00a320.00 on something I know produces the results I need than impulsively chuck a few pounds on something ten times over that never gets used. Although the quality of affordable makeup is so much better than it ever has been, I do feel that as a society we\u0027re moving towards more considered purchasing and are starting to make wise investments less often - rather than feeling the need to snap up anything and everything because it\u0027s cheap.\u00a0 Personally I adore affordable beauty and I know you do too; I know you love to find out what\u0027s exciting and what bargain buys are worth snapping up, but it\u0027s all about balance. I know you also want to know what\u0027s worth spending your money on and making informed decisions about those purchases. Although I don\u0027t think these affordable brands are going anywhere, I do feel that this year there will be a move away from creating copies and dupes - towards real innovation that stands on its own two feet. Brands including Kiko, NYX and Bourjois are creating covetable pieces (at affordable prices) without feeling the need to copy or imitate, to the point where they\u0027re sure to become cult classics themselves; with the technological advances and birth of the internet allowing practically anyone to set up shop and ship worldwide, there\u0027s no excuse to remain stagnant or just copy what everyone else is doing. Us consumers demand more, but brands are you listening? What do you think about dupes and copycat brands? Do you love them and can\u0027t get enough, or are you moving towards more considered investment purchases? Or are you just torn?   \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Right now there\u0027s a revolution happening in the bloggersphere, where women aged thirty and over are growing in number while proving the incredible value they can offer to both reader and brand - and I\u0027m incredibly proud to be part of it. About 18 months ago I started to make a concerted effort to connect with other bloggers that were also feeling a bit out of the loop and almost \u0027too old\u0027 for this digital game, but quickly it became clear that we were collectively smashing it out of the park and proving that blogging really isn\u0027t just for the teens. As a result, my blogging collective Thirty Plus was born and we now have over 700 amazing sites proving how much great content is out there for those in their 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond. (Shameless plug there: if you\u0027re not a member already and want to be part of something awesome, find out more and sign up via the website.) As we hit our stride and start to plan some incredible collaborations with brands this year, it got me thinking about why I\u0027m so excited and proud to be a 30+ blogger - and why we\u0027re not going anywhere but up.  I\u0027M PROUD TO KNOW WHO I AM Too many bloggers are apologetic or afraid of standing out. Too many cookie cutter influencers are copying one another because they each think the other has the secret to success, when the actual secret is all in being unique. I\u0027ve been blogging for nearly seven years and during that time I\u0027ve evolved as a woman, but also as a content creator; I\u0027m not afraid to be exactly who I am, share my opinions and put myself out there as an imperfect specimen of Twenty-First-Century-Life. Although I wish I lived in an all-white apartment and had a perfect figure, I know that I\u0027m more than that - and I\u0027m proud of it. I\u0027m a 34 year old who is passionate about politics, self-acceptance and emotional wellbeing; I care about making positive change, I\u0027m not afraid of calling people out when I think they\u0027re acting unethically and I can deal with the fall-out when it undoubtedly comes. It\u0027s all water off a ducks back to me, which makes me even more passionate about sharing my thoughts and opinions. There\u0027s no dumbing down or avoiding hot topics on here! MY EXPERIENCES ARE WELL ROUNDEDThis time ten years ago I can tell you that I was self-absorbed, self-critical and had very little perspective on the world around me. Experiences provide you with benchmarks from which to base opinions and actions, as well as proving that you\u0027re not the centre of the universe; not everything is about you personally and a different opinion doesn\u0027t mean that you\u0027re unlikeable - debate is healthy and should be actively encouraged. Experience comes with age and experiences are the lifeblood of any digital space - without them it quickly becomes a very dry and one dimensional space. I KNOW A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT A LOT OF STUFFGenerally speaking, the longer you\u0027ve lived the more you pick up from experience. As a result I know a lot about the beauty industry, how it works behind the scenes, what ingredients are must-haves, the trends that are around the corner, which new launches are actually just re-hashes from ten years ago and what is actually genuine innovation. Over the last thirteen years I\u0027ve worked on a multitude of brands and been responsible for everything from in-store marketing and television campaigns, to social strategy and digital media; this exposure gives me a great perspective and allows me to share that with you guys to in turn help you increase your knowledge and understanding. In my opinion that\u0027s far more valuable insight than a nineteen year old saying \u0022ooooh pretty\u0022 at everything that lands on their doorstep - and why I religiously read blogs such as British Beauty Blogger. (Her knowledge of the industry is insane.) \u00a0 WE NEED TO SEE MORE DIVERSITYI for one am increasingly bored of seeing the same bloggers time and time and again being held up as the ultimate in digital creators. They\u0027re always twenty-something, white, middle class, beautiful and carrying a designer handbag - but the beauty of the bloggersphere is that we come in all shapes, sizes, colours and ages. Some of my fave blogs right now include Danielle Vanier for her plus sized sass, Adorn Girl for her beautiful photography and insight, as well as Fashion For Lunch for her colour-filled playfulness. (It helps they\u0027re all championing the 30+ age group too!) There are so many incredible women out there doing incredible things, but if they don\u0027t fit the traditional mould they\u0027re practically invisible; I\u0027m making an effort to show there is more than one type of blogger out there by putting more of myself on here (you may have noticed much more of my face of late!) and the reception has been so positive. It just proves we want to see something fresh and a tad more relatable than what we\u0027re being spoon-fed by the media. I CAN TALK ABOUT PRESSING ISSUESBeing confident in yourself means that discussing mental health, smear tests, feminine hygiene and dealing with putting on weight (amongst a tonne of other things) isn\u0027t as scary or \u0027off brand\u0027. My \u0027Lets Talk About It\u0027 series last year did incredibly well and encouraged so much conversation about topics that had previously been untouched; I have plans to build on that this year and continue to talk about issues that are important to me personally. Being older and (somewhat) wiser also means I can feel confident in sharing opinions, insights and commentary on current events and not being afraid of using my influence for more than just pushing a new face cream.

I\u0027m a big fan of the wing, but it\u0027s taken me an age to pick up the skills required to make it half decent: get the angle wrong, the length too big or the symmetry completely wonky and it\u0027s all ruined. How many mornings have you spent trying to even out your liner in the mirror, just for the whole look to keep getting bigger and bigger until you resemble a Winehouse tribute act? Well, if that\u0027s a common issue for you then you simply NEED this little gadget from Beauty Blender in your life - because, *dramatic voice* let me assure you, it will change it.  This unassuming little rubber triangle (rather fetchingly called Beauty Blender Liner Designer and looks closer to a guitar pick than I\u0027d probably like,) can be placed along the base of the lower lid to create the perfect angle for your flick. You simply place it where you need it to go and draw along the edge using your eyeliner pen, paying attention to the length of the flick; because of the texture and material it\u0027s impossible for it to bleed or smudge, leaving behind a clean and sharp line that\u0027s incomparable to what I can achieve freehand. Replicate this on the other side, using the line you\u0027ve already drawn and the residue on the tool (you can see the line on the edge, so you can use that as a guide on the other eye!) to create the most symmetrical pair of wings you\u0027ll have ever seen. Although it\u0027s a little flimsy piece of plastic, it does come in a case to prevent it from getting dirty or lost - which also features a handy mirror if you need to use one on the go. The Liner Designer is easy to wash by running it under the sink or cleaning with a face wipe, ensuring it\u0027s reusable and probably going to last you for as long as you can find it. At \u00a310.00 it does seem expensive for a little triangle of rubber, but the idea and ease of use makes it thoroughly worth that crisp ten pound note; I honestly don\u0027t know how I used to create flicks without this! If you\u0027re feeling thrifty you could probably create your own or find one on eBay for a fraction of the price, but I\u0027m all over this like a rash. Those little things you never knew you needed eh?

Most of the perfumes in my collection are from brands including Jo Malone, Shay \u0026 Blue and Miller Harris - although there\u0027s also a sprinkling of fashion brands (including Chanel, YSL, Burberry and Chloe) to keep my reportoire current, on-trend and also elegant. Generally speaking I bypass anything that\u0027s too \u0027high street\u0027 or \u0027celebrity\u0027 and anything that\u0027s pink and sparkly, mainly because they\u0027re either too sweet or too floral for my personal tastes. That\u0027s not to say they don\u0027t have value, but they\u0027re usually not my cup of tea. I say usually, because sometimes something comes along and pleasantly surprises your nostrils and puts your inner scent snob in its place.  As a kid of the 90\u0027s and 00\u0027s, Juicy Couture are a brand I grew up with seeing all over the pages of fashion magazines and newspapers; their tracksuits were the look du jour at one point, with everyone going crazy for a touch of pink velour. I\u0027ve always had a bit of a love\/hate relationship with the brand in general - it reminded me of my university days, Paris Hilton, watching Legally Blonde on repeat and feeling like a walking fake tan advert. (How times have changed eh!) Their fragrances have always been incredibly successful, but as a 34 year old woman I thought my days of Juicy Couture were well and truly over. Despite that, they come along and launch Viva La Juicy Sucr\u00e9 and prove that you\u0027re never too old for a touch of OTT bling and a spritz of something sparkling. This latest incarnation in the Juicy fragrance franchise takes inspiration \u0027from the Viva girl\u2019s playful personality\u0027 and provides \u0022an irresistible confection of delectable fruits and sweet florals, which flirt with warm vanilla and sensual sandalwood.\u0022 Unlike the other fragrances in the collection, this is fresher and more citrus, providing a more mature twist on sweetness while still keeping it lighthearted and fun. (You can tell that from the bottle alone: a drizzle of icing sugar sits on top, while the base sits within a golden cake case!) The scent opens with the fresh fruity notes of sparkling mandarin, juicy red currant and gardenia for a feminine edge; at the heart, orange flower and jasmine blossom are mixed with peach nectar and finished with almond cream; the base notes of vanilla extract and sandalwood provide a creamy warmth alongside crushed cocoa beans. I was all ready to sniff this and feel a little overwhelmed (I actually packed headache tablets for the launch event, just in case!) but as soon as I breathed it in my nostrils relaxed and appreciated the uplifting notes for what they offered. Although this is sweet, it\u0027s not sugary sweet; the fruity notes and sandalwood ensure the sweetness of the vanilla and cocoa is kept secondary to something all the more wearable. Although the rather extravagant marketing campaign is all about sugar overload, don\u0027t let that put you off having a sniff for yourself; although the juice nods to sweetness, the composition is more like a yummy cake with a touch of sugar on top than a box of chocolate you immediately devour. It may not be something I reach for daily, but it\u0027s definitely something I could learn to love over time. Whether you\u0027re obsessed with sweet scents, love the rest of the Juicy fragrances or simply want to explore Viva La Juicy Sucr\u00e9 for yourself, then you can get your hands on it right now. You\u0027ll either love it or hate it, just like the tracksuits. \u00a0  SHOP THE SCENT JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

Some trips have been for work and others for pleasure, but with so many nights spent between freshly laundered sheets dreaming of a pancake breakfast the following morning, it got me thinking about why staying in a lovely hotel is really so special. I\u0027m lucky enough to get to experience some of the most luxurious and special locations as part of my job (I\u0027ve stayed in the Rosewood London and Babington House in the last two weeks alone,) but I\u0027ve also been making a concerted effort to book overnight stays and weekend getaways in my spare time too. My boyfriend and I have been breathing in the rustic Cotswold scenery while enjoying mini breaks at The Trout At Tadpole Bridge and The Fuzzy Duck in the last few weeks, simply just because; it doesn\u0027t have to cost a fortune, but a night away from home can refresh the mind and provide something to look forward to during a dreary winter\u0027s day. So if you need a little pick me up, or simply an excuse to wack out the credit card and book yourself an escape, here are the reasons I think staying in a luxury hotel is such a pleasure.  AN EXCUSE TO RELAX We\u0027re often so focused on getting from one day to the next, ticking off our to-do list as we go, that time just runs away from us; it\u0027s hard to relax or take some time for ourselves, even when we\u0027re supposedly chilling out at home. A night away in a hotel helps you leave those worries behind, while the change of scenery and really refresh the senses. BREAKFAST IN BED It\u0027s such a simple pleasure, but I just can\u0027t get enough of breakfast in bed - made my someone that\u0027s not me! Starting the day off with a full belly of expertly crafted food and a steaming cup of coffee just puts a smile on my face and a spring in my step. Pancakes, eggs or croissants, it really doesn\u0027t matter as long as it\u0027s yummy.\u00a0 ALL THE BEAUTY MINIS What is it about the little bottles of shampoo, shower gel and body lotion that are so exciting? Why are we always so desperate to take home the mini tubes of free toothpaste and even a packet of cotton wool buds? I love discovering what beauty freebies are lurking around the bathroom, even if I don\u0027t intend to use them; you never know what new brand you\u0027ll discover, or when that disposable toothbrush will come in handy.\u00a0 A SOAK IN THE TUB Although I have a bath at home and try to take some time out in the tub every week or two, the facilities in hotels are often incomparable. Giant freestanding bathtubs are my faves, not only because they\u0027re super instagrammable, but because they make you feel like royalty. Slipping into the bubbles and sipping on a glass of something cold is the ultimate escape - even if for only fifteen minutes.\u00a0 AFTERNOON NAPS Possibly my favourite thing about checking into a hotel room is falling immediately onto the bed and basically having a mid-afternoon nap. Often traveling is exhausting, but the call of a giant comfy hotel bed can help ease that lethargy and leave us feeling refreshed.\u00a0 THE BEST PILLOWS I\u0027d like to know the secret of hotel pillows, because they\u0027re always so fluffy and comfy. I\u0027m a little obsessed with cushions and pillows (we sleep with three each and have six more that go on top for decoration purposes!) but I just can\u0027t seem to replicate the feeling of diving into a pool of feathers at home. (If anyone knows what magic they use to get the pillows so comfy, let me know!)\u00a0 WAKING UP IN A NEW DESTINATION The best bit about waking up in a hotel is undoubtedly being in a new location; the possibilities and opportunities to explore are endless, even if you\u0027re only there for a day. Whether you want to go for a walk, find a cute cafe or go shopping in the town\u0027s boutiques, it\u0027s always a change from your usual routine.\u00a0 What are your favourite things about staying in hotels?\u00a0   \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Last week I had one of those. I was all up for rocking a sassy outfit, but when it\u0027s freezing and miserable outside you can only reassess and step out of the door in a cosy jumper dress in a colour to match your mood. This winter I\u0027ve been embracing the jumper dress for the first time ever and I have to say I\u0027m all over it: they\u0027re cosy and comfy without requiring any kind of effort, but look like you\u0027ve actually put a little thought into your attire. Although this little number from Next is one of my current faves, the colour means I feel the need to up-the-outfit-ante with a rather delicious looking handbag that will make me feel like a boss (even though I\u0027m secretly wishing it to be nap time.) Meet my new baby: the Givenchy Antigona in black, with little silver stud details that I just can\u0027t get enough of. Hubba hubba.  I\u0027ve been dreaming of this bag in grey for such a long time, but I just couldn\u0027t justify the price tag knowing how many others were waiting around in my cupboard to be used. However, when I popped by Bicester Village and saw it on sale it was hard to resist - so much so I went back to the shop a couple times to try it on and see if I was really that in love with it. (Spoiler, I was.) This is why I love Bicester Village: you can pick up items you coveted at full price on the catwalk for sometimes less than half the price a few months later, while still enjoying that designer shopping experience. (FYI I got this for about a third off the usual retail price, and in black! Unheard of!) It looks utterly divine and is large enough for everything I need, while the chunky zip and studded details give it a modern edge. It\u0027s just what I needed to spice up an otherwise bland outfit and help me forget about the frizzy mop on my head caused by the day\u0027s drizzle.\u00a0   As for the watch, this is also my new obsession. Henry London have a huge number of different designs and colour-ways that ensure your arm candy has a little twist; I kept things simple by choosing a white strap and face (it goes with more than black, believe it or not!) and matching the metal details with my current rose gold jewellery obsession. The watches are beautifully made and you can even get the backs engraved with a special message, making them the perfect gift or keepsake. I\u0027ve got my eye on a couple others for spring (more on that soon,) but in the meantime it\u0027s worth checking out their selection available online. In a nutshell, the day was a bit of a washout but lots of coffee and cake with good friends made it all okay again; and it helped we all had my new handbag to coo over.

On one hand I\u0027m embracing the changes the years bring and celebrate the fact I\u0027m older, wiser and more confident than I ever have been, but on the other hand I feel my youth slipping away one fine line at a time. I don\u0027t want to look like a teenager again, but the onset of deep wrinkles really quite worries me at this stage in my life (I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll come to love them as they appear later down the line!) Anything I can do to delay the onset of the ageing process, make my skin more radiant and reduce the appearance of those little crinkles, I will - within reason. Personally things like botox and seriously invasive procedures just aren\u0027t quite me, but give me any lotion or potion and I\u0027ll slap it on happily with the aim of reducing those signs I see every day in the mirror. My skincare regime is expansive and I invest a lot of time massaging in expensive creams and taking my supplements, but that doesn\u0027t mean there isn\u0027t always something more effective and somewhat revolutionary around the corner.  Elizabeth Arden\u0027s Ceramide Capsules were launched in 1990 and have become a global best seller. This bio-engineered, skin-identical ceramide formula was available in a first-of\u2013its-kind single-dose capsule format, removing the need for preservatives and making skincare incredibly portable. If you\u0027re wondering what Ceramides are, then essentially these precious lipids form up to 50% of the skin\u0027s moisture barrier and help to keep our complexions looking youthful; they\u0027re the \u0027cement\u0027 that holds your skin cells together, creating a smooth and radiant surface. Inevitably the level of these Ceramides significantly drops as we age; although historically it was thought this didn\u0027t happen until the later years, increasing research has shown the decline in quantity starts from when we hit thirty. (You will have lost about 40% of your skin\u2019s ceramides by your 30s, and more than 60% by your 40s. Ouch.) This decrease in essential lipids causes skin to appear dry, dull and can result in wrinkles, unevenness and loss of firmness - all the signs we try so hard to counteract. Can you believe that the science bods behind Elizabeth Arden were the ones to first discover and harness the power of Ceramides? So much so that they trademarked the name! The original Ceramide Capsules were incredibly popular because they worked; they contained a combination of oils and lipids to help nourish the skin while plumping the surface for a smoother and more radiant glow. In celebration of 25 years of the capsules, Elizabeth Arden are re-launching them with a new and improved formula that offers triple the power of the original. When used daily, they can enhance skin\u2019s barrier repair function, increase moisturisation within the surface of the skin and minimise the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.That\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about! So what\u0027s in these little gold capsules that makes them so special? Fatty Acids (including Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid and Vitamin E) help maintain the integrity of the skin\u2019s lipid barrier for healthy-looking skin; Cholesterol helps retain moisture levels to support the stratum corneum and help protect skin from dehydration; Phytosphingosine, a lipid naturally found in the skin, allows and encourages the skin itself to produce the ceramides it needs; Sea Fennel Extract helps to enhance skin cell renewal as well as increase luminosity and skin smoothness; a Botanical Complex features Alfalfa Extract, lipids from olives and hydrocarbons from coconut oil to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, increase hydration levels and soothe skin; Tsubaki Oil is rich in Oleic Acid, Vitamins A, B, D \u0026 E, and nourishing Omegas 3, 6 \u0026 9, so has been added to help improve elasticity, minimise the look of fine lines and wrinkles while enhancing moisture for smooth, supple skin; and finally Retinyl Palmitate is a Vitamin A derivative that works to support skin\u2019s own natural collagen for a firmer look. That\u0027s a lot of power in one little dose. Most \u0027anti ageing\u0027 formulas focus on hydration via hylaronic acid, increasing cell turnover for brightness and improved texture or encouragning collagen production; these capsules are full of so much more and actually help to re-build the skin from within. I\u0027ve always been aware of these iconic capsules, but I made the (incorrect) assumption that they were targeted at 40 or 50+ skin rather than being able to meet my changing 30+ needs. After getting to know the science and evidence behind the skincare, I\u0027m confident that this is what I need to take my skincare regime to the next level and help fend off those fine lines a little longer. I love the fact they\u0027re portable (no more lugging huge bottles of serum away with me) and easy to integrate into my routine (they don\u0027t have to replace anything but can just boost your existing products - I use after Elizabeth Arden SuperStart and before my usual moisturiser) even if they are a little expensive (roughly about \u00a31.00 a capsule depending how many you buy at once.) The texture is like a very lightweight non-greasy oil that glides over skin and absorbs pretty quickly to leave the surface feeling instantly smoother and more radiant; I\u0027ve only been using these for a couple of weeks but I\u0027m already hooked. I\u0027ve yet to look 25 again, but with ongoing use I\u0027ve no doubt I can certainly look my best. And as for the ten years younger claim? The capsules have been proven to take up to 10 years off the look of skin, based on a clinical study of 44 women aged 36-64 after 12 weeks of use. (They did this by measuring the characteristics of skin before and after the study, known to occur during certain decades; so much were the results, that many moved from one decade characterisation to the previous in only a few months!) In addition to this, 100% of women in the study showed an improvement in the overall appearance of their skin and 95% demonstrated a significant improvement in visible firmness after just two weeks. A lot of brands try to make incredible claims or sell you pots of stuff you don\u0027t need off the back of falsehoods, but in this instance I\u0027ve seen the data and the corresponding images - and millions of women around the globe can\u0027t be wrong. I\u0027m slapping these on my face like there\u0027s no tomorrow and can\u0027t see that changing any time soon; who knew a little golden capsule could make such a big impact? Have you ever used these golden capsules? Would you be tempted to give them a go?  The Elizabeth Arden \u0027Advanced Ceramide Capsules Daily Youth Restoring Serum Capsules\u0027 are available now priced as follows: 90pc \u00a384.00 \/ 60pc \u00a366.00 \/ 30pc \u00a339.00.

It\u0027s all about how many followers you\u0027ve got on Instagram, what your Klout score is and the number of YouTube views each video gets. I get it, I really do; brands want to generate as much exposure as they possibly can and to get maximum return on their investment, so the number of eyeballs is the easiest thing to focus on. When historically we\u0027ve all only had magazine circulation figures (often hugely inflated or manipulated) to go on, this is the one statistic that keeps being measured as the ultimate level of success - and expectations keep increasing. With some superstar bloggers and vloggers speaking to millions of people every single month, it\u0027s easy to get wrapped up in seeking as high a number as possible and using that as the only metric of success. However, this numbers-led culture within the bloggersphere is causing one huge problem that seems to be getting increasingly worse: bought followers.  It\u0027s surprisingly easy (and cheap) to buy your way to the top these days. All it takes is a couple of quid, a few minutes out of your day and BOOM you\u0027ve got yourself another couple of thousand Instagram followers. The platforms that offer these services are becoming increasingly savvy, ensuring their fake accounts look and feel like real ones - they have real names, real faces and real photos on their own feeds, but if you look a little harder you start to see through the illusion. What\u0027s even more worrying is that these falsified accounts aren\u0027t just appearing on little known blogger\u0027s feeds, but on some of the most well known and respected in the industry; even one of the biggest UK beauty editors is well known for buying her way to 100k Instagram followers and as a result is heralded in the press as one of the best beauty insiders on social media. Although that\u0027s a problem in itself (lies always get caught out in the end,) what I find increasingly worrying is the number of brands, PRs and industry insiders that know about these falsified audiences and continue to work with the bloggers regardless. I\u0027ve had conversations with a handful of brand representatives myself about the issue and have been met with shrugged shoulders, only for them to book the influencer in question for a big campaign a few weeks later. I was worried and baffled: was I the only one thinking it was unethical to buy your way to the top, ask for money to be part of a campaign only for your audience to be significantly non-existent? As a result you may have seen the poll I ran a couple of weeks ago on Twitter (see the poll here,) which asked the question: \u0022Do you care if (you suspect) a blogger has bought their social followers?\u0022 The result was this: unsuprisingly 85% of the bloggers who answered said they did, with the remaining 15% not caring at all. (I get it: you may just like their content and don\u0027t give a rats arse what\u0027s going on with their following, real or otherwise. In fact some of the bloggers suspected to have hugely falsified followings are actual incredible content creators - which makes it even more frustrating.) However, 160 PRs answered my poll and around 20% of them admitted they didn\u0027t care if they knew or suspected an influencer had bought their followers. That means that around 20% of my sample study knowingly work with bloggers, vloggers or social media starts that they suspect or know to have a fake following. And do not care. Let\u2019s just reiterate that once again: they do not care. My problem with this is two fold: 1. that brands are being fed information on bloggers that is one-dimensional, inflated and inaccurate, so their ongoing expectations are distorted, and 2. that the bloggers in question are often charging a small fortune, getting the great campaigns and taking work away from other people that are working to build a true and authentic audience. When it\u2019s no longer a free lipstick or invitation to a cocktail reception, and instead exotic holidays, designer handbags and campaigns that see their faces plastered over billboards and in stores nationwide, it\u2019s time to start saying this is not ok. It\u0027s all very well and good to ignore it or think \u0022don\u0027t worry, they\u0027ll get caught out in the end!\u0022 or \u0022cheaters never get ahead!\u0022 But the problem is they are; they\u0027re getting ahead and they\u0027re getting ahead at the expense of everyone else. My thoughts are somewhat torn on who is to blame for this current situation and who is making it worse. As bloggers we\u2019re always being driven to justify why a brand should want to work with us, and those conversations 99% of the time focus on numbers; very few discussions involve influence, engagement or relevancy - because at the end of the day everyone\u0027s objective is to sell stuff, the focus should be on how likely an audience is to buy based on a recommendation or feature, not how many people may have seen a picture of it and scrolled on by. (Some of my blogger friends have much smaller audiences than me, but their engagement is insane; their followers lap up everything they say, buy everything they recommend and comment on every single thing they publish. You just can\u0027t buy that sh*t.) These questions and constant justifications make us all a little paranoid about our numbers, so it\u0027s easy to understand why some may feel the need to give themselves a helping hand.\u00a0 In a nutshell: brands want numbers, PRs need to deliver on numbers, PRs search for bloggers with big numbers so they can tick boxes and report on the great job they\u0027ve done, bloggers feel a bit inadequate with all the questions and focus on numbers, bloggers buy followers, numbers make PR happy, PR makes brand happy by giving them big numbers. Do you see how it\u0027s a vicious circle? Until the circle ends, until everyone makes a concerted effort to educate brands about the importance of engagement and relevancy, this shady behaviours will continue and it\u0027s only going to get worse. I\u0027ve heard so many stories about bloggers creating a whole fake identity and blagging their way into campaigns, launches, trips and experiences off of the back of a falsified Instagram account - because nobody bothered to check. I\u0027ve seen digital influencers scoop their own makeup collaborations and big brand campaigns from an inflated social presence - because nobody bothered to check. If you\u0027re a PR or work with bloggers in some capacity, please take a little time and bother to check (for everyone involved.) I\u0027ve been running my blog for nearly seven years and I\u0027ve had some amazing experiences and opportunities land in my inbox. It\u0027s hard not to compare yourself to people that have got twice the following you have in half the time, but I have to remind myself that I have a niche and I\u0027m proud of that niche; everything I\u0027ve done has been generated because of hard work, love and passion - not cheating. Although buying a few followers doesn\u0027t mean what the blogger produces doesn\u0027t have value (often the opposite,) it does seem incredibly unfair on those of us that creep up gradually with pure grit and determination. This kind of activity reflects badly on all of us; it reflects negatively on the industry as a whole, when we\u0027re already perceived as giggling girls with swishy hair and nothing much to say for themselves. We have to justify our existence so often that it\u0027s becoming exhausting, and this really isn\u0027t helping. Collectively we need to keep bossing it and proving that we DO have value, that we DO have something to say, that we DO have influence and we won\u0027t be going anywhere fast. Right now I feel like I\u0027m in the digital version of The Emperor\u0027s New Clothes: we all know the followers aren\u0027t real, including the said Emperor\/Empress, but everyone is just smiling sweetly and applauding because they\u0027re afraid of whatever fall out will follow. Here\u0027s hoping fakeness isn\u0027t on-trend again this SS17.  \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

The aroma of freshly cut grass, the first sprig of a daffodil and a cold glass of rose wine as the sun goes down is such a refreshing antidote to the heavy and woody notes of winter. I do adore the onset of colder weather and the scent of a cracking fire, but after a few months it\u0027s a welcome change to finally start to disrobe and celebrate the sun once again. As we get that little bit closer to Valentines Day (love it or hate it) there\u0027s a plethora of new fragrances that are hitting shelves to offer the perfect gift for a loved one, but there are also so many that are so pretty that they\u0027re definitely worth treating yourself to too. (Who needs a guy\/gal to buy it for them anyway?) I\u0027ve currently got three faves on rotation that I couldn\u0027t wait to share with you - which will you choose?  1. Jimmy Choo L\u0027Eau (From \u00a336.00)\u00a0 An incredibly successful mini brand of its own, the Jimmy Choo scent collection is normally a bit too sweet or too heavy for my personal takes - but this is a much lighter, fresher and more wearable addition that\u0027s perfect for transitioning into spring. Top notes of hibiscus flower and bergamot blend with sweet nectarine and floral peony, but the notes are grounded by base notes of cedarwood and musk. You can definitely sense the delicate fruity notes which make the feminine floral elements softer and more modern; it reminds me somewhat of DKNY Be Delicious and the uplifting experience it provides with every spritz, but packaged in a glamorous and timeless bottle that will look so much better on your dresser.  2. Jo Malone Cologne Intense Myrrh \u0026 Tonka (From \u00a374.00)\u00a0 Not for the fainthearted, this fragrance is incredibly intense and long lasting - you only need a spritz on your neck to be doused in the scent for the rest of the day. (Beware of over-applying, because you will give yourself a headache.) Described as \u0022Namibia, with its sand dunes and warm desert colours, conjured up the romance of faraway lands\u0022 by Jo Malone\u0027s Fragrance Director, this is a truly unique and exotic scent that warms the senses and comforts the mind. For those of you that love oriental perfumes, this is definitely for you. With top notes of lavender, a heart of warming myrrh and base of tonka bean, this makes a statement and feels expensive without overbearing the wearer.  3. Elizabeth Arden White Tea (\u00a336.00)\u00a0 If you have a preconception of what this may smell like because of the brand name, leave all of that at the door and open your mind. Elizabeth Arden are known for their classic, somewhat heavy and overly floral fragrances - but this new incarnation is completely the opposite. Light, fresh, modern and elegant, this is a fragrance you\u0027ll want to wear every day; it\u0027s like the white t-shirt of scents - classic, unobtrusive, but brings everything together seamlessly. The notes include mandarin, clary sage, white fern, sea breeze accord, white tea, rose, musk, amber, madras wood, ambrette seed and tonka bean, together bringing about something complex yet incredibly simple. This is the perfect scent to mindlessly apply every morning without having to worry if it goes with your outfit or mood.

Although many believe it to be an unnecessary commotion against the Trump regime which will make no difference, the #WomensMarch was so much more than that; the images that have filled my social media feeds over the last few days have shown that this was more than just a popular protest against a new president, but a way of us all expressing our frustration, anger, sadness and worry of what\u0027s to come. In the last few decades we\u0027ve progressed so much on the road to equality, but we\u0027re really not there yet - if anything, we\u0027re set to take a step back over the coming few years as Trump revokes legislation that made a real difference to people far beyond US borders. (Partner that with the impending Brexit mess, where established European equality rights are under threat too, and we\u0027re in a bit of a mess.) And that\u0027s why these marches went global; that\u0027s why these events saw people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, sexualities and ages take to the streets with their sassy signs to show everyone that they\u0027d had enough. That\u0027s why the fight is just beginning.  DO NOT BE AFRAID OF CALLING YOURSELF A FEMINIST\u00a0As far as I\u0027m concerned (unless you\u0027re an arsehole,) everyone should be a feminist. (It\u0027s a scary word, I get it, but if you\u0027re not a feminist then please explain your reasoning?) In case you\u0027re wondering, feminism is defined as a range of political movements, ideologies and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish and achieve political, economic, personal and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities in education and employment, access to healthcare and to be at no disadvantage simply because of their gender. Who would not want that? As a feminist (and yes I\u0027m proud to use that label,) I\u0027m willing to do what I can (no matter how small) to make a change for the future and impact lives around the world in a positive way. I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to have grown up in an environment that encouraged me to do whatever I wanted to do, to break down barriers and to reach for the stars; yet I have still had to fight for equal pay and recognition in the workplace, to justify my place at a meeting table simply because I have boobs and to prove that I can be interested in lipstick and politics simultaneously. Over the last few decades we\u0027ve progressed so far, but there is still a long road ahead of us - as we can all testament to when we really start to think about what impact inequality has on a daily basis. (And this is even before we start to consider the inequality of WOC, LGBT and disabled women. Then I just want to cry.) As women we still make less than a man for doing the same job - whether that\u2019s in tech, as a CEO, as an athlete or as a doctor. As women we still don\u2019t have full rights over our own bodies, as men are continually debating and making choices that impact our uteruses. As women we still have to pay tax on sanitary products because they\u2019re classified as a \u2018luxury\u2019. (If men had periods you know that would have been scrapped decades ago.) As a woman we still have to justify our outfit choices and defend ourselves when men think they have the right to touch us. As a woman we still have to fight to breastfeed in public and apologise for those we offend in the process. As women we\u2019re constantly scrutinised for our appearance, whether that\u2019s a celebrity who is a bit soft around the tummy or a Prime Minister who happens to like shoes. As women we\u2019re valued on our looks rather than our brains, but suffer vitriol if we dare take care of our appearance more than is deemed acceptable. It\u0027s exhausting.  BE THANKFUL FOR THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE YOU If it wasn\u2019t for those that came before us standing up and wanting to be heard, we would not have the lives we do now. We wouldn\u2019t have had the right to an equal education or even the right to work; we wouldn\u0027t have had the right to vote or have a say in our own futures; we wouldn\u2019t have access to birth control, the right to choose or able to have a legal abortion carried out in a safe environment. Every day I\u0027m grateful for those that paved the way and made my existence what is is, because without them our situation would be way worse than it is - but it could still be better. For those of you that don\u0027t understand why women marched in their millions this past weekend, or wondered what difference it would really make, and for those of you that don\u0027t deem yourself disadvantaged because of your gender: we are not equal, whichever way you look at it, and that is why a revolution is coming. I can understand those that want to shy away from hard hitting issues, who prefer to let others do the hard work in their name, but be respectful of the fact you would not be enjoying the opportunities you do if it were not for others. \u00a0 WHAT CAN WE DO? HOW CAN WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE? We all have a voice, no matter how big or how small, and now is the time to use it. If you have a platform, put it to work: share stories, start conversations and show people what needs to be changed. If you\u0027re a blogger or an influencer, don\u0027t be afraid of using your platform to talk about more than shoes or mascara - because if you\u0027re interested in women\u0027s rights then your readers will be too. Join the Women\u0027s Equality party, who are trying to make change in the UK by championing equality and women\u0027s rights. They want to achieve equal pay, equal parenting, equal access to support and equal opportunities by getting their voices heard in parliament; joining the party costs as little as \u00a34.00 a month and could make a huge difference. Follow Women\u0027s March London and be part of their \u002710 Changes In 100 Days\u0027 campaign. In the coming weeks they\u0027ll be providing ways in which each one of us can keep the momentum moving following the marches, as well as providing a UK focal point for those of us that feel like they want to do something but they\u0027re not sure what. The first of which is...\u00a0 Email our Prime Minister, Theresa May, and ask her to champion women\u0027s equality whenever there\u0027s an opportunity - starting with her meeting with President Trump this coming Friday. Ask her to affirm our country\u0027s belief that women\u0027s rights are human rights, and to not waiver in the upholding of our ideals in favour of a trade deal. Write her a letter, send her an email or pop her a postcard with your thoughts to 10 Downing Street, SW1A 2AA or via email.number10.gov.uk. And above all, stay informed. Read the newspapers, watch the documentaries, discuss what\u0027s going on with your colleagues. Within days of Trump taking office he\u0027s reversed a bill that provided healthcare and support to women in developing and war torn countries, because the same institutions that provide support may also facilitate an abortion. That\u0027s not ok and it\u0027s not the solution. Stopping access to healthcare and safe treatment only causes women to be forced into dangerous situations; they\u0027re not able to stand up for themselves, so its our responsibility to champion their causes for them. Right now my feeds are jampacked with inspirational content and discussion around these issues, and I really hope that doesn\u0027t waiver. Although I\u0027m realistic and know that a few marches won\u0027t change the world, it\u0027s important that we still stand up and try to make a difference in the years to come.

I adore it as a way to be visually inspired, see what some of my favourite bloggers are up to and connect with brands that mean a lot to me, but it\u0027s also easy to spend hours endlessly scrolling through utter rubbish in the hope you\u0027ll find that one square that makes it all worth it. It\u0027s addictive, but it can also leave us feeling a bit crap if we\u0027re not careful enough to peel ourselves away from the screen. If, like me, you get a bit happy on the \u0027follow\u0027 button and your feed is full of stuff you\u0027d rather not see (or Instagram isn\u0027t the inspirational, motivational and dreamy place you keep hearing others talk about,) then there are six main types of account you really need to get rid of, stat.  THE SERIAL POSTERYou know who I\u0027m talking about. The one that insists on posting ten pictures up all at once every time they step outside, jamming up your feed with grainy\/blurry\/boring shots that are better placed elsewhere. Some people don\u0027t grasp the fact that Instagram should be an edited feed, not a flurry of pictures that aren\u0027t even captioned - and most of the time these people are your mates (or even your mum.) Take my advice and unfollow them, keeping in touch via other platforms where the spamming isn\u0027t so prevalent. \u00a0 THE CLEAN EATING MAFIAI get it. You eat all the green food, whizz up a smoothie for breakfast and boss your steamed chicken dinner every night - but I\u0027m over here munching on a biscuit and wondering what\u0027s even in that gloopy green mess. We all need a little inspo, but sometimes it\u0027s just too much and ends up making us feel bad about our own decisions; if those super clean food accounts are making you whimper, rather than keeping you motivated, click unfollow and get yourself a bacon sarnie.\u00a0 THE \u0027WHO ARE YOU\u0027-ER\u00a0\u00a0Ever connected with someone at an event or birthday party, clicked on a suggested account or followed an old work colleague who you\u0027ll probably never see again? If you can barely remember who they are or why you followed them, you don\u0027t need that in your life. THE CHEESE-FEST MOTIVATOR\u00a0A good quote or motivational post can set you up for the day ahead, there\u0027s no doubting it, but if it becomes a cheese-fest of verbal diarrhea then it\u0027s time to back away slowly. Nobody is *that* upbeat or feels like their #girlbossing every moment of every day; if the \u0027motivational\u0027 posts are making your eyes roll so hard that you\u0027re giving yourself a headache, maybe that account is not for you. THE IRONIC ANIMAL ACCOUNTAt one time you may have thought a talking goat was hilarious, it bringing an undeniable amount of joy into your life, but that time has passed and you\u0027ve seen more goat gifs than one person could ever need. I\u0027ve followed people that post fifteen pictures of their hamster every day, or those that are obsessed with dressing their dog in the latest fashions, but that gets real tired real quick. And when a dog is more stylish than you, there\u0027s a problem...  THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL SH*T\u00a0We all compare ourselves to other people; it doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re a superstar or a mum of three living in Leeds, looking at aspirational and overly curated pictures all the time can make us feel a bit \u0027meh\u0027. Comparison really is the thief of joy, so if there\u0027s an account you look at that just makes you feel a bit sh*t (about your looks, weight, lifestyle, home, belongings, life choices, career and so on,) just unfollow that crap and get on with your life. Whether it\u0027s the blogger that gets all the opportunities you want, the friend from school that\u0027s had some kind of \u0027She\u0027s All That\u0027 makeover or that super lean fitness guru who makes you ashamed to even look at your stomach, pass go and collect that \u00a3200. Have we all unfollowed? Is our feed now renewed with tonnes of great content we never knew was there?

Over the last couple of weeks there hasn\u0027t been that much newness (or new-on-my-desk-ness) worthy of your attention, so this time around it\u0027s an edit of some of the more exciting bits and pieces that have made their way to me over the last month or so - and for one reason or another I\u0027ve not written about them previously. When the sunshine seems so far away and the cold weather is playing havoc with our skin, it\u0027s the perfect time to give yourself a pamper and get to know some new treats that will undoubtedly tickle your fancy. I\u0027ve pulled together an edit of ten things I think you\u0027ll love getting to know, none of which cost a fortune either.  1. Maskorea 3-in-1 Sheet Masks (\u00a37.99 each)\u00a0 Sheet masks aren\u0027t new (in fact they\u0027ve been clogging up my inbox for the best part of a year,) but what intrigues me about the versions from Maskorea is that they come with two little sachets of product to ensure you get the most benefit from the experience. Each features a cleanser to use before and ensure there\u0027s no trace of makeup or dirt left to prevent the enriched mask from getting to work, as well as a night cream to apply afterwards to boost the benefits and hydrate the skin. Available in three variants (Too Many Late Nights, Turn Back The Clock and Instant Glow) this is a fun take on the trend. Personally I prefer my usual skincare products to those included, but I love the idea.\u00a0  2. \u0027B\u0027 Hylaronic Acid Facial Spritz (\u00a37.99)\u00a0 Usually more popular in the summer, facial spritzes are a great way to perk up skin or refresh the senses during the day. However, this version from Superdrug\u0027s own skincare range \u0027B\u0027 is enriched with hylaronic acid to help plump the skin and restore moisture when skin is looking and feeling a little parched. You can use it as a first step when applying your morning skincare, spritz over makeup for a dewy and refreshed look or add a touch throughout the day when you need a boost; the mist isn\u0027t the finest and it takes a bit of getting used to before you get the perfect amount, but it\u0027s a great little treat to pop in your handbag when the cold zaps all the goodness from our complexions. A steal at \u00a37.99 too. 3. Beauty Bakerie Lip Whips (\u00a316.00 each)\u00a0\u00a0 Matte liquid lipsticks are definitely my faves right now, thanks to the long-lasting result and modern twist on traditional lipstick formulas that just seems to give a look new life. These little gems from Beauty Bakerie are du jour; not only do they look gorgeous and remind me of chocolate ice cream, but they apply beautifully to leave an incredibly pigmented result behind. You do have to thoroughly exfoliate and delicately tap balm into the surface of lips to get the best result (and maybe if you\u0027re concious of fine lines give this a miss,) but they\u0027re just beaut. If you can\u0027t get your hands on a Kylie kit, these are a great alternative.  4. Temple Spa \u0027Work It Out\u0027 Muscle-Tox Bathing \u0026 Massage Oil (\u00a325.00)\u00a0 I\u0027ve been back in the gym this January, which means I tend to spend the day after each session feeling a little sore. This beautifully scented oil has been specifically developed to help ease tension and help massage away stress, thanks to a blend of 21 Mediterranean essential oils (including juniper, clove, cypress and thyme) in a lush base of sesame, avocado, jojoba, kukui, grapeseed, soybean and coconut oil. It also claims to \u0027detox\u0027, but I\u0027m not convinced on that front; for me it\u0027s enough to have an affordable bottle of oil that\u0027s full of goodness and will help to restore my flexibility after a long soak. 5. La Roche-Posay Respectissme Extension Mascara (\u00a316.00)\u00a0 What\u0027s this? Skincare favourite La Roche delving into the world of makeup? Is this a sign of things to come in 2017? Developed for more sensitive eyes and those that wear contacts (myself included,) this mascara is pleasant enough - but not groundbreaking in terms of performance. However, it has gone through rigorous tolerance testing on people with severe atopy, under dermatological and ophthalmological control; it\u2019s fragrance and paraben free, while the pigments used are purified and nickel-controlled to avoid any eye or skin irritation. Rather interestingly the mascara contains an \u2018anti-tears formula\u2019, with Reconstituted Lachrymal Liquid, which imitates a tears natural composition ensuring eyes do not react or run. There\u0027s still a lot of stuff in here that could be a potential irritant so it\u0027s worth having a look at the ingredient list before you buy, but I like the idea of this for those of you that suffer with eye irritation and usually have to steer clear of mascara.  6. Piz Buin Glacier Cream (\u00a311.00)  Got any skiing trips coming up, or just simply want to stock up in case there\u0027s a snowstorm? This tin is inspired by the very first formula of Piz Buin launched in 1946. It\u0027s water-free and formulated to help protect against extreme elements, while simultaenosuly protecting against UVA and UVB rays; I love the little tin and think it\u0027s the perfect thing to slip into your ski suit (or handbag.) Just be careful of the formula though, as it\u0027s white and quite thick, meaning you need only the smallest amount; this really isn\u0027t to be used under makeup daily, but instead is a hardworking helping hand for when you\u0027re exposed to the elements.  7. L\u0027Occitane Solidarity Balm (\u00a34.00)\u00a0 Ever year L\u2019Occitane launch a limited edition little pot of balm that does good for your skin - as well as for the community. Formulated with 98% shea butter, this year it\u2019s a violet-scented Women\u2019s Solidarity Balm which nourishes the lips, rescues fragile cuticles and pampers the body. 100% of the profits will be used to support women\u2019s leadership in developing countries, which has never been so topical as it is today. The balm itself is incredibly lightweight and nourishing, whilst providing just a hint of fragrance to perk you up on a dreary afternoon; the slightly sweet scent perfectly complements the bright and bold packaging, making it \u00a34.00 well spent. Buy one for all your friends.  8. GlamGlow Plumprageous \u0026 PoutMud Treatments (\u00a318.00 and \u00a316.00)  Known for their trademark face masks, GlamGlow are expanding into the world of lip treatments with the launch of new plumping formulas in both gloss and matte finishes. In a nutshell PoutMud is basically a lip balm that offers a little tingle and subtle pout, while the Plumprageous helps to add more noticeable volume before you apply your usual lipstick or gloss. Unlike a lot of plumping products that leave my lips stinging, these provide a very comfortable sensation; although I\u0027m not overwhelmed by the result, I don\u0027t really want to look like I\u0027ve just had lip fillers. The balm comes in a very cute silver pot and is practical enough to pop in your bag, while the Plumprageous comes in a metallic tube that twists to reveal the leaf shaped applicator. These won\u0027t blow your mind, but they are worth trying out if you\u0027re a fan of lip plumpers. 9. SoEco Rose Gold Blush Brush (\u00a36.25)\u00a0 You would be forgiven for thinking this little number was twice the price, but SoEco are a brand that prove you don\u0027t have to spend a fortune to get a great tool. I\u0027ve used them many times before, but the latest collection included rose gold ferrules which bring them bang up to date; the soft bristles are a pleasure to use, while the bamboo handle is sustainably sourced and custom made for the most comfortable grip. Available in Tesco, Sainsbury\u0027s and Bodycare stores, this is one accessories brand you\u0027ll want to get on your radar.  10. L\u0027Occitane Shea Butter Hand Balm (\u00a321.00) If you adore the original hand cream already, then I guarantee you\u0027ll be obsessed with this even more nourishing version. Enriched with 25% more shea butter than the cream, this super rich balm melts when it comes into contact with the skin to leave the surface soothed and nourished - with no greasy feeling whatsoever. Because it\u0027s so rich I find I use less than I would normally opt for, meaning it provides even more value and a longer-lasting tube. My hands have really been suffering of late, but just a couple of applications of this has zapped away dryness to leave digits that look ten years younger. It\u0027s love.  Which one of these ten have got you excited?

After the long festive period, where heinous jumpers and all the layers are fashion du jour, I feel like I need to break out of the mould and start wearing my spring wardrobe; the irony is that January and February are actually the coldest months and we *need* those layers that we\u0027re so keen to shred. So what do we do when the sun comes out a little and it\u0027s not three degrees outside? We embrace some winter florals, park the boots for a day, layer up with a fur stole, pack the sunnies... And take some photos! I know, what is this madness? An outfit post on LBQ? Although I\u0027ve always been incredibly interested in fashion and spend a fortune on clothes and accessories, it\u0027s never been something I\u0027ve really focused on documenting - mainly because I\u0027m not a flawless size eight twenty-something, but also because I\u0027ve never had someone to actually take my picture. As you may have seen from my post on how my blog will change this year, I\u0027m making a concerted effort to put more of me on this site and be proud of who I am as a 34 year old with 36G boobs and a bum to match. So here goes... Please be kind!  THE OUTFIT When I\u0027m in London and rushing about on the tube from meeting to meeting, the temperature seems so much higher than it is outside the city. I find it far more comfortable to wear something covered but thin, layering up with something I can snuggle up inside and keep the warmth within. I\u0027m all about the comfy shoes, a little bag to keep my essentials (the giant one with my laptop and other daily essentials is off shot!) and a touch of style to keep me feeling fabulous amongst the immaculately dressed. My leather jacket is a tran-seasonal gem that keeps me warm and adding an edge to a look that could have been a little too girly. Get the jacket from Oasis here for \u00a3160.00.  THE JEWELLERY\u00a0Right now I\u0027m obsessed with rose gold, and even more obsessed with Pandora. I\u0027ve had this bracelet after buying it for myself just before Christmas last year; the idea was that it would give my loved ones something meaningful to buy me as a gift, without panicking about what the hell to get the blogger who (seemingly) has everything. I adore the delicate nature and way you can curate your own collection - and the fact that every charm has meaning. I\u0027m also wearing a Pandora floral ring alongside Accessorize \u0027Z\u0027 collection ring, which is a much more affordable version of the Monica Vinader one I\u0027ve been lusting after for an age. Check out Pandora\u0027s rose gold collection here.   THE SUNGLASSESWinter sunglasses are always tricky. You don\u0027t want anything too summery or delicate, as they often contrast too much with the dark colours and harsh shapes that come with seasonal fashion, so for me it\u0027s about finding something dark and classic while still being on-trend. I adore this slightly quirky style that pretty much goes with everything; it\u0027s retro whilst not taking over, looking just as good on my head as on my face. Have a look at ASOS\u0027s winter appropriate black sunglasses here.   THE WATCH\u00a0For years I had an allergy to nickel so I couldn\u0027t wear watches (something that friends and family never got, as they always used to buy me them for my birthday thinking I didn\u0027t have one,) but I\u0027ve finally grown out of it and as a result have become a little obsessed with wrist candy. Olivia Burton is one of my fave brands right now (I\u0027ve got two of their watches and adore them,) for being classic with a twist, feminine without being girly and great quality without costing a fortune. This one is even embossed with my initials on the strap - just coz! All the Olivia Burton timepieces are here.   THE DRESSAt home I spend my life in jeans and jumpers, so whenever I\u0027ve got somewhere a bit more exciting to go I bring out the sass. This dress is from Marks \u0026 Spencer of all places (I know! They have *so* many little gems right now,) and it fits like a dream. The long sleeves, high neck and lining make it perfect for chilly days, while the pattern ensures it\u0027s a little more exciting than a plain black number; as soon as I saw it I knew I had to have it. What was even better is that it was half price in the sale! Have a look at the M\u0026S dresses you need this season here.   THE BAG\u00a0I\u0027m such a blogger cliche, but I really do love a designer bag. For me they\u0027re a worthy investment and look as good as new for years to come, providing so much more pleasure than something that loses its shape and looks a tatty mess after a few weeks. I\u0027ve made the decision to invest in bags that I will adore for years to come, and this little green Mulberry number is just the ticket. The beautiful leather and striking colour give me goosepimples; although it\u0027s now a few seasons old, a green bag is more of a staple than you\u0027ll ever realise! You can\u0027t go wrong with a Mulberry like this.   THE SHOESWhen I posted a picture of these on Instagram it was one of my most liked and commented on pictures ever. It seems we all love a cat shoe eh? These are from Topshop and are a \u00a325.00 inspiration of Charlotte Olympia\u0027s numbers which are about thirty times the price; they\u0027re cute and practical, adding a little bit of interest to even the plainest of outfits - although the velvety material doesn\u0027t like the rain, so wear them carefully! They also come in baby pink if you feel so inclined. (They\u0027re no longer available online, but you can still get them in a few stores.) Check out Topshop\u0027s flats here.   THE FUR\u00a0How glamorous do I feel with this (fake) fur stole wrapped around me? It\u0027s giant in size, but it instantly vamps up an outfit while keeping you seriously cosy; I love it over a leather jacket for an edgy look, but it goes just as well over my white winter coat for seriously cold days. I\u0027ve worn it so much over the winter season and know it\u0027ll be with me right until it\u0027s time to pack up the opaques. It was the best \u00a335.00 I\u0027ve spent this winter - it looks so much more. Get it here for only \u00a324.50 in the ASOS sale!   So there you have it. My first ever outfit post on London Beauty Queen. I\u0027m still learning my poses, but I hope you\u0027ve enjoyed something a little different...

Over the years I\u0027ve upped my game and taken the time to understand the benefit a targeted regime can bring - both in the immediacy and long-term. As I hit my mid-thirties I\u0027m starting to see those fine lines appear around the eyes, the gentle sagging of my jawline and the change in texture of my overall face; a bad night\u0027s sleep can be seen instantly under my eyes, while a week or two of over-indulgence takes double that amount to recover from. However, it isn\u0027t all doom and gloom; I\u0027m fully embracing the changes that are appearing as a sign of experience and having lived my life, even if I want to give them a helping hand and minimise them wherever possible. One of the big things I\u0027ve learned over the years is that skincare products really are #BetterTogether; that is, using a serum alongside an eye cream, moisturiser and overnight treatment will provide far better results than relying on a standalone product. Each provides the skin with targeted care and ingredients that have been included for specific benefit, but together just four steps can help totally change the look and feel of your skin.  SERUM: Often formulated with concentrated and hard working ingredients, this lightweight and easily absorbed product will help target issues (i.e. fine lines) and rectify them over time. As we start to age this becomes even more important and an essential part of any regime. EYE CREAM: The skin around our eyes is incredibly thin, so usual moisturisers and products are too heavy, clogging the area and causing puffiness. An eye cream will help reduce the appearance of dark circles and fine lines, without overloading the delicate skin. DAY CREAM: Providing a moisture hit that\u0027s essential for maintaining radiance, a great day cream will lubricate the skin and help to plump the skin so your complexion looks refreshed. Most also contain SPF, which helps protect the skin from the sun\u0027s damaging rays. NIGHT TREATMENT: A rich and nourishing treatment that gets to work as you sleep is your secret weapon. Our bodies are far better at \u0027repairing\u0027 while we slumber as they\u0027re less focused on keeping our bodies moving, meaning it\u0027s the perfect time to lather on a hardworking cream and awake feeling refreshed. Although I rarely use a singular brand for the entire offering (preferring to dabble in lots of different treats and bring you an edit of my faves,) one that I would always recommend is No7. Their \u0027Protect \u0026 Perfect\u0027 range is iconic in more ways than one; a decade ago it was the first skincare innovation that was independently proven without doubt to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles over time. The press went mad; women went even madder. Boots sold a years worth of stock in two weeks, waiting lists filled up and bottles were being sold online for three times their value. It became a multi-award winning cult classic that\u0027s adorned the bathrooms of millions of women across the globe - because, put simply, it works. They\u0027ve expanded the range to include more targeted and even more effective products over the years, and it\u0027s one of the affordable ranges I will always recommend to those wishing to invest in an effective skincare regime. This January No7 has gone one step further and revolutionised its entire Lift \u0026 Luminate range (targeted at 40+ skin and including Day, Night and Eye Cream) to help women\u2019s skin look at its absolute best; hot on the heels of the No7\u2019s Lift \u0026 Luminate Triple Action Serum (the UK\u2019s No1 serum brand*,) they\u2019ve added the same powerful technology to the skincare range as is in the serum. This new and improved blend of ingredients helps women achieve even better anti-ageing results that really deliver, especially when using all four of the products together. The unique \u0027triple action\u0027 technology makes Lift \u0026 Luminate No7\u2019s most hardworking skincare regime yet; having been proven to help tackle the most common signs of ageing to deliver maximum results - wrinkles are visibly reduced, skin appears lifted and is noticeably firmer, while skin tone is more even. Rather interestingly, when clinically tested 88% of women saw even better results when they used the new day cream with the Lift \u0026 Luminate serum - proving without a doubt that doubling up will give you even better results in as little as two weeks. So what are these magic ingredients that help skin look and feel so much better, I hear you ask? Well all of the products are enriched with Matrixyl 3000, No7\u2019s most effective anti-wrinkle technology that\u0027s a powerful peptide blend which helps restore more youthful looking skin; additionally Hyaluronic Acid helps provide additional skin-firming benefits through its powerful water retaining abilities, hibiscus extract helps support collagen production, making skin look and feel smoother and firmer, while a \u0027Lightening Complex\u0027 (containing Indian gooseberry and Vitamin C) works to help rebalance melanin content in the skin, providing a more even skin tone and a fading of visible pigmentation. As Lift \u0026 Luminate isn\u0027t quite suitable for my skin type just yet, I\u0027m giving a stash to some of my loved ones so they can put it to the test on my behalf in the next few weeks and report back - because we\u0027re all #BetterTogether right? What\u0027s even better is that nine other bloggers from my Thirty Plus collective are also putting the product to the test, so you can pop on over to their sites to see how they\u0027re getting on too. (Links are below!) Even better than that? I want FIVE of you guys to get involved too, putting the entire regime through its paces in the coming weeks so I can share your stories and thoughts here on London Beauty Queen; I\u0027ve got FIVE full sets of all four products up for grabs (worth \u00a393.90) so if you want to be a part of the experience, just enter via the widget below. No7 believe that not only skincare is #BetterTogether, but we are too - so it\u0027s great to see an opportunity for so many women to come together and take the first step on a joruney together.

You\u0027ve probably seen it all over your Insta-feed and your favourite bloggers have probably been professing to it being the most life-changing thing they\u0027ve ever read - but with good reason. I devoured this little treat of a book over a few dreary January evenings, when I really needed a kick up the posteria and a way to start my new year off with a new outlook; devoured is probably the best adjective to describe how most people will consume the words that are on the page, as it\u0027s hard to put down once you get going. Our digital world has led us to be ever more concerned with the way we\u0027re perceived and how we document our lives online; whereas before our dodgy hairstyles and badly curated outfits were lost for all time, now you only have to scroll back through a Facebook feed to see the horrors in all their glory. With the opening of our lives and their every detail, comes the inevitable scrutiny and comparison - and that in turn can leave us feeling dejected, somewhat of a failure (be it career wise, handbag wise or simply achieving those life milestones that you\u0027re \u0027supposed\u0027 to tick off by a certain age) and giving too many f*cks about what everyone else thinks.  Pair that with FOMO (fear of missing out,) because every event and after-work drink is documented across every social media outlet going, and we\u0027re left feeling like a bit of douche. Not only do we collectively waste too much time on comparison and attempting to please others, but as a result have far less time to spend giving a f*ck about what\u0027s actually important to us. That\u0027s where Sarah Knight and all her ingeniousness comes in. \u0027The Life-Changing Magic\u0027 and her \u0027Not Sorry\u0027 method provide a simple, yet incredibly effective, way to look at your life and reflect upon what\u0027s important to you personally. She sets out her reasoning behind the method by comparing it to those tidying books that have been so incredibly popular, suggesting that the easiest way to ensure maximum life satisfaction is to clear away the clutter and find those gems that really do make you happy. Split into four sections (things, work, friends and family,) the book encourages you to digest each area in turn and work out what actually you don\u0027t (or shouldn\u0027t) give a toss about and what you want to care more about moving forward. Whether it\u0027s annoying family gatherings that leave you feeling sh*tty, charity collections that guilt you into parting with your hard-earned cash, or friends that drain your time with baby showers and hen do\u0027s that you\u0027d really rather skip, this book not only facilitates change but provides you with ways of backing out that don\u0027t leave you looking like the bad guy. In the interests of transparency, I went into this experience thinking I didn\u0027t give much of a f*ck anyway; maybe it\u0027s age, maybe it\u0027s just the fact that I\u0027m confident in my own skin and outlook, but on the whole I haven\u0027t cared about what people think for some time. Although my 20\u0027s were filled with paranoia and an inability to love myself for who I was, my 30\u0027s have proven the complete opposite: I know who I am, what I have to offer and revel in my own uniqueness. I\u0027m not afraid to have an opinion, share an opinion or to decline an offer of something I don\u0027t want to do, but that doesn\u0027t mean that this little pink book couldn\u0027t reaffirm my viewpoints and leave me feeling invigorated. There were still lots of things that I realised I was spending too much energy on, rather than focusing on more important elements that will actually make me happier in the long term. As I turned the pages I found myself nodding profusely; the book isn\u0027t rocket science (in fact it\u0027s just common sense,) but it takes someone to write it down and tell you when you\u0027re good and ready for it to make a difference. Living online it\u0027s easy to get caught in a little bubble where numbers, designer handbags and perfectly applied eyeshadow are the most important things in the world - this book allows you the headspace to realise they\u0027re really not, and to identify other things your energy would be far better directed to. In case you need a little inspo, here are some of my key areas of \u0027less f*cks given\u0027 versus where I want to re-direct my energy. Writing them down is incredibly cathartic in itself. Giving Less F*cks 1. What people online think about the way I look. (Yes I know I have a fat arse.) 2. Spending my time in pointless meetings and wasting away afternoons \u0027networking\u0027. 3. Worrying that I eat too much chocolate and drinking too much wine. 4. Number and stat checking constantly, for fear that I\u0027m not \u0027big\u0027 enough. 5. Comparing myself to others: \u0022I haven\u0027t got married\/bought a house\/had a kid yet, sob.\u0022 Giving More F*cks 1. Championing women over thirty and showing diversity online. 2. Using my time efficiently and meeting up with friends I haven\u0027t seen in an age. 3. Being healthier in general and spending quality time getting fit. (Hello new gym membership.) 4. Generating an engaged audience that really appreciate the stuff I write about. 5. Focusing on being happy and grateful for what I do have\/what I\u0027ve actually achieved. So why do we all need a \u0027F*ck Budget\u0027? Because, quite frankly, we\u0027re all wasting our time giving too many f*cks about stuff that really isn\u0027t that important - when we could be focusing on other stuff that makes us happy. It doesn\u0027t make a difference if you want to swap up christenings or karaoke for saving the planet or catching up on Netflix, but it\u0027s about using your precious time and energy in the ways that you want to. If you need some perspective and to stop worrying about everyone that disagrees with you online, or just a boost of confidence for when you\u0027re sharing that next selfie, you need this book. It\u0027s so easy to feel guilted into something, but The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k provides clarity and an actionable way of channeling your energy into more worthy causes. I am 100% down with this and recommend you jump aboard too. If you had to give less f*cks about one thing, what would it be and why? The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k is available from Amazon, priced from \u00a31.99. It will be the best couple of quid you\u0027ve ever spent. Promise. PS: the reason there\u0027s not a picture of the book? I totally gave it to a friend the moment I finished it so she could benefit from Sarah\u0027s words of wisdom too; I forgot to actually take a photo first, so was the feeling of urgency to share!

(Yes, I\u0027ve finally jumped on that bandwagon.) The festive season is a distant memory, we\u0027re starting to feel the pinch of that early December paypacket, looking out the window we\u0027re met with a gloomy landscape and our resolutions have already been discarded alongside that yoga mat and exercise ball. It\u0027s easy to feel like you\u0027re in a never-ending slump, but you can pick yourself up without flitting off to an exotic location or winning the lottery. In my opinion, it\u0027s all about your outlook and how you use this \u0027down time\u0027 to your advantage - so you can kick the rest of 2017\u0027s butt all the way to fabulousness.  READ A MOTIVATIONAL BOOKI\u0027m all over the motivational literature at the moment, having just read The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k and recommended it to all my friends. (More on that later.) There\u0027s something about using those cold dark nights to find your inner #GirlBoss (also a great read) that\u0027s incredibly rewarding, both in the immediate and long-term. While you\u0027re constrained by rain, an empty purse and the lack of motivation to walk any further than to the fridge, use it to plot our world domination and take inspiration from those that have gone before you. This will be your year - so snuggle up and start planning. CUDDLE UP WITH A BLANKETThe texture of a fluffy warm blanket is incredibly comforting and nostalgic, transporting us back to those safe childhood memories and making us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I\u0027m a firm believer in the benefit a great blanket can bring - so much so I have about ten scattered around my flat for when the need arises. Seeing as the hygge trend isn\u0027t going anywhere fast, the chilly evenings provide the perfect excuse for wrapping up and sipping on a cup of tea (perhaps with that aforementioned book.)  BREATHE IN THE FRESH AIRIt\u0027s easy to spend our January days wrapped up against the world, but sometimes the benefit of breathing in the fresh air can be overlooked. Wandering amongst nature is good for the soul (and the body,) so as soon as the rain finishes why not pop on your wellies and go for a country stroll. It doesn\u0027t have to be far, but breathing deeply and absorbing new surroundings will leave you feeling invigorated - as well as much more appreciative of your home comforts when you walk through the door.\u00a0 BAG YOURSELF A BARGAINHave you noticed that the sales are never-ending this year? Every time I pop into town there are more discounts and even more bargains to be had, as retailers do everything they can to shift their unwanted stock. It\u0027s the perfect time to bag yourself a super bargain for only a few quid; whether you want to stock up on cosy jumpers to see out the winter or start planning your summer wardrobe, there are some unmissable offers that won\u0027t break the bank. If you\u0027ve got leftover vouchers or gift cards that need spending, even better: not a penny of your own cash will see the light of day! It\u0027s amazing what a new sweater can do for a woman. GET PLANNING HOLIDAYSWishing you were somewhere else? Make that a reality by getting yourself on Pinterest to Wanderlust your way into next season. There\u0027s nothing better to cheer yourself up than something to look forward to, so start doing your research and plan your dream trips for the year ahead. By booking in advance you can get some fantastic deals, while airlines such as Virgin are still offering super-affordably flights to the most exotic of locations. If you need inspiration, pop by your local travel agent and pick up some brochures to flick through over a Starbucks; most allow you to put down a small deposit and pay the balance off over the coming months, so you don\u0027t have to even wait until payday. PICK UP A NEW HOBBYWith all these free evenings and weekends (is it just my friends that have gone into hibernation?) it\u0027s time to start something new and pick up a hobby. Whether you\u0027ve been meaning to get into cross-stitch, re-kindle your love of stamp collecting, dabble in watercolours, become an expert baker or learn how to make your own clothes, a trip to Hobbycraft may be just what you need. For me it\u0027s calligraphy; I received a starter pack for Christmas and have been spending those rainy evenings practicing my skills, which is incredibly relaxing and a welcome break from Netflix. The feeling of accomplishment leaves me wanting to get even more crafty, and all I need is a piece of paper. COOK THOSE HEARTY MEALSI\u0027m loathe to switch up my usual routine for a plate of leaves, just because it\u0027s apparently detox season, but the onset of gloomy days and vacant diaries does mean I have more time to prep for hearty and delicious meals. Right now I\u0027m obsessed with stews, vegetable pots and everything that involves little more skill than chucking it all in a bowl and leaving to simmer for a couple of hours; the result is delicious, filling and good for you, plus the process fills time that would otherwise be spent eating cakes. Talking of which, baking is a great way to experiment and find better ways of making your favourites; try swapping in ingredients for superfoods or more natural alternatives and see what you can come up with.\u00a0  CATCH UP WITH A MATEDon\u0027t underestimate the power of a good natter over a cup of coffee. You don\u0027t have to book an expensive dinner or have a night out on the town, but spending time with those important to you will help to lift you up and leave you feeling ready to tackle the week ahead. Why not plan some mini trips or days out for the coming months so you have something to look forward to, or write a list of museums and exhibits you\u0027d love to see? Filling your diary is not only satisfying, but it gives you a goal and occasion to look towards - rather than staring at blank pages and wishing summer would come around already. Above all, don\u0027t let January defeat you. It may all feel doom and gloom right now, but amazing things are around the corner so now is the time to plan for them. 2017 will be what you make of it, so make it a blooming good one.

The start of a new year always brings with it endless possibility and the opportunity to refresh, re-look and re-jig - as well as to plan for what\u0027s to come. I\u0027ve no doubt this year will be full of exciting projects, big launches and new social platforms to get our teeth into, but I\u0027ve also no doubt there will be big change in the bloggersphere; in order to continue to sustain our positions and influence it\u0027s vital to grow and evolve, changing up the norm for something new. 2017 marks seven whole years of London Beauty Queen and over that time I\u0027ve refined my tone of voice and definitely pin-pointed who I am as a woman, entrepreneur and blogger; as a result, this year a few things will change on this here corner of the internet to make it something I can continue to be passionate and excited about.  NEW TOPICS, NEW INTERESTSBeauty will always be my first love (for many reasons,) but I also have a passion for books, history, travel, fashion, politics, feminism and championing awareness of issues that are not often discussed. Over the last months I\u0027ve started to dabble in those areas to gauge the response, but I\u0027ve realised that a lot of my consideration should be based upon what *I* want to write about - because the rest will follow. I want to have the freedom to discuss topics outside of just the world of beauty, without worrying that they\u0027re not quite \u0027on brand.\u0027 I want to explore being a woman in her thirties and I want to share the clothes I\u0027m wearing; I want to give you the lowdown on what I\u0027m reading and where I\u0027m going, alongside what I\u0027m thinking and what I\u0027m passionate about. Already I have trips booked and outfit shoots in the bag, and I can\u0027t wait to share it all with you in the coming months; for the first time in a long time, I\u0027m excited. FEWER PRODUCT REVIEWSIn my opinion, this is the year that the simple review site starts to die. Collectively we want more than just endless reams of beauty reviews: we want opinion, insight and to be educated. I\u0027ve made the decision to focus less on product features and more on trends, predictions, edits and new ways of presenting what I\u0027m using - so the information is more useful to those of you looking for recommendations. For a long time I feel like beauty bloggers have been in the hands of brands, bowing to pressure to feature one thing over another because of obligation rather than passion, and I for one am stepping out of that game. I\u0027ll continue to bring you news and information on what\u0027s new via my \u0027New This Week\u0027 features (the first one of which you can find here,) but unless I\u0027m absolutely convinced you need to know about something on a stand-alone basis then it\u0027ll make room for something a little more interesting. MUCH MORE OF ME\u00a0Yep, get used to my mug because you\u0027ll be seeing a lot more of it on here. In a shiny world full of perfect twenty-somethings with better eyebrows than I\u0027ll ever have, it\u0027s hard to build up the courage to share pictures of my slightly greying hair, expanding waistline and increasingly wrinkly under-eye area. But it\u0027s also incredibly frustrating to see a whitewash of little more than cookie-cutter moulds all over my feeds. I feel somewhat of a responsibility to my fellow thirty-somethings to put myself out there a little more, personalise my site and enable you all to feel like you know the face behind the blog. I\u0027ve found a great woman squad that has helped me gain the confidence to just crack on with it, as well as connecting with people that can actually take my picture - hoorah! To be honest, that\u0027s most of the battle, so I\u0027m making a concerted effort to let people snap my face and revel in posting it on the internet. \u00a0 Here\u0027s to a great year ahead. I hope you enjoy the changes and what\u0027s to come as much as I surely do!  \u00a0SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE (EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS \u0026 CONTENT YOU WON\u0027T FIND ON THE BLOG!)  \u00a0Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

In contrast, Korea doesn\u2019t emphasis that transition as much as they do just overall skincare maintenance from an early age.

I still remember a time when I couldn\u2019t get my hair to grow or look healthy once it passed my shoulders. I used to color it way too often, switching from blonde to brunette to blonde again, I used heat on it almost every day (blow dryer, flat iron, curling iron) and was way too aggressive with a cheap brush that left my hair broken and distressed. Eventually, I gave up on pursuing colors that were not close to my own and decided to focus on bringing back the healthy and soft hair I once had when I was young. For the most part, the biggest thing I did was just left my hair alone. I didn\u2019t color it, I let it air dry and I switched from a brush to a wide-tooth comb.\u0022 Read 5 Products for Healthy Hair by Gal Meets Glam\u00a0   Olivia Palermo \u0022To start off the new year, I wanted to put together a group of favorites (along with a little tip) to giving you the strongest and healthiest styled hair you can have. Don\u2019t forget, to keep it looking its best, make sure to always get your hair cut or trimmed (depending on if you\u2019re growing your hair out) every two months!

This will make your hair feel ultra soft and it helps reduce breakage and makes your hair super shiny.

Ob langj\u00e4hrige Beziehung oder Kennenlernen mit Herzpochen, wie im letzten Jahr. Ich kann mich aber partout nicht erinnern, ob der Valentinstag irgendwann etwas Besonderes f\u00fcr mich war. Um ehrlich zu sein, habe ich nur die Momente im Kopf, in denen ich eher scherzhaft dar\u00fcber sprach. F\u00fcr mich war er immer, wie jeder andere Tag auch. Ich wollte nie teuer essen gehen, habe nie Blumen oder einen romantischen Tag in der Therme erwartet. Falls das in den letzten 10 Jahren doch einmal passiert ist, dann entschuldige ich mich f\u00fcr die falsche Aussage, aber ich habe es vermutlich einfach nur vergessen. Weil er keine Priorit\u00e4t f\u00fcr mich hat.  Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich habe eine sehr romantische Ader. Wenn ich sie denn zulasse. Und ich liebe es, wenn ein Mann sich Gedanken macht, mich \u00fcberrascht oder etwas Verr\u00fccktes plant. Es ist nur tausend Mal sch\u00f6ner, wenn das nicht am Valentinstag passiert. Wie vor einigen Monaten mit einem Picknick an der Alten Donau oder mit einer Konzertkarte f\u00fcr eine Band, die ich liebe. Einfach so. Und verdammt, ich vermisse das. Als Single hasse ich allerdings nichts mehr, als diesen k\u00fcnstlich erzeugten Druck, am 14. Februar unbedingt in Begleitung eines Mannes ausgehen zu m\u00fcssen. Wo es einem fast peinlich sein muss, wenn man kein Date hat. Kein Wunder, dass Tinder und Co. zurzeit scheinbar Hochkonjunktur haben. Dieses Jahr f\u00fchlt sich dieses ganze Dating wie ein Balanceakt sondergleichen an. Falsches Timing wie so oft oder keine Gemeinsamkeiten. Fehlende Ambitionen und zu hohe Erwartungen. Kein Funke der \u00fcberspringt. Pl\u00f6tzlich werde ich zur Herzensbrecherin, und glaubt mir, diese Rolle spiele ich sehr, sehr schlecht. Ganz unerwartet aber doch eine heftige Anziehung, gefolgt von dieser wohligen \u00dcbelkeit, die sich im Bauch breit macht. Erschlagen von Entt\u00e4uschung und Verwirrung. Die Spielchen h\u00f6ren nie auf, egal wie erwachsen man sich f\u00fchlt. In meinem Jahresplaner stand Ende J\u00e4nner ein Spruch, an den ich mich gerne zur\u00fcckerinnere: \u201eHast du schonmal jemanden so geliebt, dass du alles f\u00fcr diese Person gemacht h\u00e4ttest? Mach dich zu dieser Person und mach, was dich gl\u00fccklich macht.\u201c Ich versuche diesen Gedanken immer im Hinterkopf zu behalten und gerade heute habe ich beschlossen, mir selbst etwas Gutes zu tun und meinen freien Tag zu genie\u00dfen. Ich werde mir ein gutes Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck machen, entspannen, Kerzen anz\u00fcnden, Musik h\u00f6ren, schreiben und Sport treiben. Mich bei den Menschen r\u00fchren, die in den vergangenen Wochen und Monaten f\u00fcr mich da waren und den Abend mit einer guten Freundin, bei einem meiner liebsten Afterwork-Events, verbringen. Die Atmosph\u00e4re beim Kunstschatzi ist n\u00e4mlich immer ganz wunderbar und ich war schon viel zu lange nicht mehr dort. Damit ihr diesen Tag, die Woche und den restlichen Winter genauso genie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnt, habe ich beschlossen meine diesj\u00e4hrige Winter-Playlist, die ich liebevoll a not so lonely winter 2017 benannt habe, noch mit euch zu teilen. \u00dcberraschend optimistisch, kitschig und fr\u00f6hlich. Wer mich kennt, wei\u00df vermutlich, dass ich gerade im Winter zu sehr melancholischer Musik neige. Diesmal wollte ich die positiven Momente in Erinnerung rufen und vor allem mit Vorfreude auf die n\u00e4chsten Monate blicken. Denn 2017 wird ein sehr spannendes Jahr, vor allem beruflich. Ein Jahr der Ver\u00e4nderung. Nur eine Konstante gibt es: Den Valentinstag. Der bleibt so unbedeutend wie immer.   Welche Lieder sind auf eurer Winter-Playlist? Feiert ihr den Valentinstag oder ist er f\u00fcr euch auch ein Tag, wie jeder andere?  The post Ein nicht ganz so einsamer Winter und der Valentinstag.

Ich schrieb sie 2014 und doch kommt es mir vor wie gestern. Genauso wie eine spannende Diskussion um kuratierten Journalismus am letzten Mediencamp. Die ist aber tats\u00e4chlich nur knappe sieben Wochen her. Und sie inspirierte mich dazu die fr\u00fcher so geliebten Linksammlungen an Artikeln die ich gerne gelesen habe, wieder mit euch zu teilen. Nicht nur, weil ihr meine pers\u00f6nliche Auswahl immer gesch\u00e4tzt und gerne gelesen habt, sondern auch weil ich finde, dass wir Blogger uns wieder viel mehr gegenseitig unterst\u00fctzen sollten und ich so auch wieder viel bewusster andere Beitr\u00e4ge lese. Was so flott dahergeschrieben wirkt, dauert \u00fcberraschenderweise n\u00e4mlich doch l\u00e4nger als man denken w\u00fcrde. Gerade, wenn man versucht eine interessante Mischung zu bieten und nicht nur Blogs zu verlinken, die sowieso jeder kennt. Ich w\u00fcnsche euch viel Spa\u00df beim Lesen und hoffe, dass euch die Idee mindestens genauso gut gef\u00e4llt wie mir. \u003E Nach Marrakesh will ich schon lange. Fast w\u00e4re ich im Februar hingeflogen, jedoch liegen manche Termine so ung\u00fcnstig, dass keine g\u00fcnstigen Fl\u00fcge mehr zu haben waren. Immer dieses schlechte Timing. Daf\u00fcr tr\u00e4ume ich jetzt weiter, w\u00e4hrend ich Madeleines Travel Guide dazu lese und mir die wunderbaren Bilder ansehe. \u003E T\u00e4glich Yoga machen? Jasmin hat es eine Woche lang probiert und ihre Erfahrungen niedergeschrieben. Etwas, das ich auch vorhatte und bisher nie durchgezogen habe. Immerhin schaffe ich es hin und wieder eine Einheit in meinen Alltag einzubauen. \u003E Angela geh\u00f6rt zu den Bloggerinnen, die ich schon seit langer Zeit kenne, aber gerade in den vergangenen Monaten sehr zu sch\u00e4tzen gelernt habe. Einfach, weil sie das macht worauf sie Lust hat und sie gl\u00fccklich macht. Und das sind keine Outfitposts. \u003E Ich liebe Zimt! Vor allem im Winter. Hannah und Sonja haben zwei unglaublich gut aussehende Rezepte mit uns geteilt, die ich dringend bald nachbacken muss. Bleibt nur die Frage, ob ich zuerst den Scheiterhaufen oder die Zimtknoten probiere.  \u003E Und weil es nie genug tolle Rezepte f\u00fcr Naschkatzen geben kann, gibt es auch noch die wohl am besten klingenden Chocolate Chip Cookies von Mara. \u003E Ich habe m\u00f6glicherweise schon des \u00d6fteren erw\u00e4hnt, dass ich die #Twentysomething Column von Lina Mallon einfach liebe. Sie spricht mir so oft aus der Seele und schreibt Zeilen nieder, die ich mich nie trauen w\u00fcrde zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen. Dinge, die nur mein engsten Freunde wissen, sich aber umso mehr dar\u00fcber am\u00fcsieren oder mitfiebern. Gerade, wenn es um das Singlesein geht, das bei mir nun auch wieder hoch im Kurs steht. \u201eIch h\u00f6r nicht auf mit den Flirts, den Flings, manchmal der Unvernunft, dem Spa\u00df und vor allem nicht mit der Euphorie \u00fcber die Aussicht darauf, sich vielleicht sogar wieder zu verlieben ..\u201c \u003E Wiener Redensarten gibt es so einige, bei Vienna W\u00fcrstelstand findet ihr sieben Weisheiten, die besonders gut zum Jahresanfang passen. Bisschen Schmunzeln hat noch niemandem geschadet. \u003E Geht es um Food Trends, gibt es eine Person, der ich besonders vertraue und das ist Lisa. Sie war eine Weile in Australien und berichtet nun dar\u00fcber, was wom\u00f6glich auch bald nach \u00d6sterreich kommt. Oder so in 2-3 Jahren, denn wir lieben es ja gem\u00fctlich. \u003E Was 2017 hingegen ausgedient hat? Iwona ist wie gewohnt erfrischend direkt. \u003E Sch\u00f6nes Interieur habe ich schon immer geliebt. Ich bl\u00e4ttere in Magazinen wie der Couch, st\u00f6bere bei Pinterest nach Inspiration oder entdecke auch einfach gerne die vier W\u00e4nde von Bloggerkollegen. Caro hat k\u00fcrzlich erst ihre wundersch\u00f6ne Wohnung gezeigt, in die ich mich direkt verliebt habe. Dieses Klavier!  \u003E Noch ein pers\u00f6nliches Highlight gab es in den letzten Tagen von Petra, die heuer wieder am Social Media Lehrgang der Werbeakademie unterrichtet hat und auch uns verr\u00e4t \u201ewie man g\u2019scheiten Social Media Content produziert\u201c. \u003E Ein wenig nachdenklich stimmten mich die beiden Artikel von Caro und Jessica. Es geht um Erwartungen, Druck und Ver\u00e4nderungen in der Bloggerszene. Beide sehr lesenswert. \u003E Monika habe ich vor vielen Jahren, ganz zu Beginn meiner Zeit als Bloggerin, kennengelernt. Auch wenn wir uns selten sehen, verfolge ich gespannt, was sie alles erreicht hat und blicke immer wieder zu ihr auf. K\u00fcrzlich hat sie ein inspirierendes Interview \u00fcber Freelancing, Kreativit\u00e4t und Leidenschaft gegeben und wie ich heute auch erfahren habe, h\u00e4lt sie Anfang Februar den n\u00e4chsten Vortrag bei den Creative Mornings. \u003E Auch Viki geh\u00f6rt f\u00fcr mich zu den Powerfrauen in meinem Umfeld. Sie macht so viel, kann viel und ist trotz stressigen Zeiten immer ein Sonnenschein. Erst gestern schrieb sie einen Artikel \u00fcber 10 Dinge, die man als Girlboss im J\u00e4nner tun sollte. Ein paar Punkte habe ich mir schon notiert. \u003E Ziele stecken wir uns alle, ob wir sie aber tats\u00e4chlich erreichen h\u00e4ngt oft davon ab, wie wir an Dinge rangehen und wie ehrgeizig wir sind. Vicky gibt Tipps, wie sie pers\u00f6nlich damit umgeht.  Solltet ihr meine letzten beiden Beitr\u00e4ge verpasst haben: Meinen Jahresr\u00fcckblick gab es diesmal ganz ungewohnt in Form einer Playlist, daf\u00fcr sind meine Vors\u00e4tze pers\u00f6nlicher denn je.

Die einen verteufeln sie regelrecht, viele andere brauchen diese Art der Motivation zu Beginn des neuen Jahres einfach. Eine wiederkehrende Routine, bei der es darum geht aus Angewohnheiten auszubrechen oder sie beizubehalten. Ich pers\u00f6nlich brauche Ziele und Vorhaben um mich weiterzuentwickeln und zufriedener zu werden, deshalb schreibe ich oft Listen mit Vors\u00e4tzen. Nat\u00fcrlich brauche ich daf\u00fcr keinen Jahresbeginn, aber er bietet sich an um bestimmte Kapitel abzuschlie\u00dfen, zur\u00fcckzublicken und vor allem auch zu reflektieren. 2016 war bestimmt nicht mein Lieblingsjahr, es war hart und fordernd, aber ich konnte viel f\u00fcr mich mitnehmen. Und ich hoffe, dass 2017 genauso gro\u00dfartig wird, wie es angefangen hat. 1. Auch 2017 zum Konzertjahr machen. Ich liebe Musik und denke, dass das keine \u00dcberraschung f\u00fcr euch sein wird. Ende 2015 erinnerte ich mich daran wie sehr ich Konzerte genie\u00dfe, dieses unbeschwerte Gef\u00fchl sich voll und ganz auf die Musik zu konzentrieren. Es macht mich einfach gl\u00fccklich und ich bl\u00fche dabei regelrecht auf. Ich wollte wieder mehr G\u00e4nsehautmomente und habe deshalb beschlossen einfach h\u00e4ufiger auf Konzerte zu gehen, auf mindestens eines pro Monat. Ein Jahr habe ich es durchgezogen und finde immer noch, dass es die beste Idee \u00fcberhaupt war. Ich habe mich wieder wie 16 gef\u00fchlt als ich zu Foals und Panic! At The Disco getanzt habe, bin inmitten kreischender Teenies bei Justin Bieber gewesen, habe ein wundersch\u00f6nes Lagerfeuerkonzert erlebt, stand bei Bosse, AnnenMayKantereit und Joris oft mit Tr\u00e4nen in den Augen da, habe tolle Bands wie Kytes und Gin Ga f\u00fcr mich entdeckt, den Sommer in Wien beim Donaukanaltreiben und G\u00fcrtelnightwalk gefeiert, bin zu elektronischen Kl\u00e4ngen von Palastic und Filous abgegangen und war auf dem tollsten Festival \u00fcberhaupt und liebe Macklemore, HOVB und viele mehr seitdem. Gro\u00dfartige Erinnerungen, die einem niemand nehmen kann. Ich freu mich auf die musikalische Vielfalt und die sch\u00f6nen Momente, die dieses Jahr auf mich zukommen werden. \u00a0 2. Regelm\u00e4\u00dfig auf Branchen-Events gehen und selber aktiv werden.  Social Media ist eine Herzensangelegenheit f\u00fcr mich. Seit ich blogge ist meine Leidenschaft daf\u00fcr immer mehr gewachsen und ich liebe es mich mit Gleichgesinnten auszutauschen, Neues zu lernen und meine Erfahrungen zu teilen. Im letzten Jahr hatte ich die M\u00f6glichkeit gemeinsam mit Fabian einen Vortrag auf der Uni Wien (in einem PR-Kurs an dem Institut, wo ich selber noch studiere) zu halten, war mit Viki, Denise und Nina in Salzburg bei Salt and the City und diskutierte bei einer Podiumsdiskussion \u00fcber Blogger-Relations und hielt gemeinsam mit ihnen einen Vortrag \u00fcber Bloggen und Selbst\u00e4ndigkeit. Ich sprach in der Vergangenheit auch bei einem PR-Branchenevent \u00fcber das Bloggen und Ethik, hielt spontan mit Denise eine Session auf dem Barcamp Digital und war sogar auf einer kleinen Podiumsdiskussion auf der WU Wien dabei. Ich h\u00e4tte fr\u00fcher nie gedacht, dass es mir Spa\u00df machen w\u00fcrde vor Menschen zu stehen und \u00fcber meine Leidenschaft zu reden. Manchmal lohnt es sich definitiv aus der Comfort Zone zu steigen und neue Dinge zu probieren. Wenn sich M\u00f6glichkeiten ergeben, will ich sie auch dieses Jahr wieder nutzen. Nat\u00fcrlich will ich aber auch wieder regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger auf Barcamps gehen, Konferenzen besuchen und abends die Zeit auf einem Stammtisch vergessen. Gro\u00dfartige und inspirierende Menschen kennenlernen, mit Freunden und guten Bekannten Zeit verbringen und verr\u00fcckte Ideen spinnen. Morgen bin ich zum ersten Mal auf einem Creative Mornings Event und freue mich riesig darauf, die re:publica 17 in Berlin ist nat\u00fcrlich auch schon fixiert. 2017 verspricht wieder spannend zu werden. \u00a0 3. Mehr Auszeiten und Achtsamkeit.  Entschleunigung und Achtsamkeit sind zwei W\u00f6rter, die ich in letzter Zeit sehr, sehr oft gelesen habe und auch auf mich zutreffen. In der ersten Jahresh\u00e4lfte des letzten Jahres habe ich vollkommen \u00fcbertrieben und mich \u00fcbernommen, das ging so weit, dass ich nachts oft da lag und einfach nicht einschlafen konnte oder im Stundentakt aufgewacht bin. Das kann nicht gesund sein. Deshalb habe ich mehrere G\u00e4nge runtergeschaltet, h\u00f6re wieder mehr auf mein Bauchgef\u00fchl und sage auch mal nein. Ich nehme mir nicht mehr zu viel vor und plane bewusst Auszeiten, in denen ich auch mal alleine bin. Als kleine Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr 2017 habe ich mir Ein guter Plan Pro gekauft und merke, wie sehr er mir dabei hilft diese eigentlich simplen Vorhaben immer im Hinterkopf zu haben.  4. Die Sache mit der Kreativit\u00e4t. Ich will meine kreative Ader trainieren und ausleben. Nat\u00fcrlich ist der Blog ein ganz wunderbares Mittel daf\u00fcr, aber es gibt Dinge, die ich unbedingt noch lernen m\u00f6chte. Und weil ich mir nicht alles vornehmen kann, werde ich mich dieses Jahr auf Lettering konzentrieren. Der Basic-Kurs im Februar ist bereits gebucht. Zuhause wird aber trotzdem flei\u00dfig ge\u00fcbt. \u00a0 5. Mehr lesen. Meine Aufmerksamkeitsspanne ist in den letzten Jahren massiv gesunken, gerade wenn es darum geht in meiner Freizeit zu lesen. Elendslange Serienmarathons sind kein Problem, sobald ich aber ein Buch in den H\u00e4nden halte schweife ich nach kurzer Zeit ab. Ganz generell lese ich aber viel seltener als fr\u00fcher, einfach weil sich auch meist ein schlechtes Gewissen breit macht, weil ich mich doch lieber der Unilekt\u00fcre widmen sollte. Schon vor dem neuen Jahr habe ich damit angefangen auch privat mehr zu lesen, vor allem vorm Schlafengehen. Romane findet man allerdings selten, sondern Fachlekt\u00fcre oder B\u00fccher \u00fcber Motivation, Selbstverwirklichung und inspirierende Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten. Zurzeit lese ich In Praise of Slow von Carl Honor\u00e9 und My Creative (Side) Business von Monika Kanokova, werde mir demn\u00e4chst aber Die Kunst, ein kreatives Leben zu f\u00fchren: oder Anregung zu Achtsamkeit von Frank Berzbach kaufen. Zudem m\u00f6chte ich auch spannende Artikel nicht nur online abspeichern oder \u00fcberfliegen, sondern wirklich konzentriert lesen. \u00dcber ein brand eins Abo denke ich schon l\u00e4nger nach, vielleicht schenke ich es mir heuer. \u00a0 6. Sportlich endlich wieder durchstarten. Es ist so wie es ist. 2016 war gesundheitlich ein sehr bescheidenes Jahr. Ein verstauchter Fu\u00df, der monatelang wehtat, h\u00f6llische Schmerzen, viele kleine Wehwehchen und eine Operation. Sport kam da leider viel zu kurz, aber das soll sich dieses Jahr wieder \u00e4ndern. Schon im Herbst habe ich mich bei einem neuen Fitnessclub angemeldet, der noch im J\u00e4nner aufsperren soll und bin unglaublich motiviert gemeinsam mit einem Freund trainieren zu gehen. Functional Training ich komme! Nebenher werde ich weiter Pilates und ein bisschen Yoga machen. Und vielleicht kommt auch meine Lust aufs Laufen wieder. \u00a0 7. Die Reisepause beenden.  Letztes Jahr bin ich bis zum Sommer unglaublich viel unterwegs gewesen, war st\u00e4ndig unter Strom und irgendwann so ausgelaugt, dass ich beim blo\u00dfen Gedanken daran wieder wegzufahren Panik bekommen habe. Nach dem ruhigen Herbst und Winter merke ich aber, dass meine Reiselust mich langsam wieder packt. Bisher ist neben der re:publica in Berlin, nur ein Urlaub in Bosnien fixiert. Ob mein langj\u00e4hriger Wunsch, mal aus Europa rauszukommen, 2017 erf\u00fcllt wird? Ich lasse mich \u00fcberraschen. Und ihr bekommt bald eine kleine Bucket-List zu lesen.  8. Erinnerungen festhalten. Mein Blog fing wie viele andere als pers\u00f6nliches Tagebuch an. Ich erz\u00e4hlte von meinem Alltag, von Dingen die mich bewegen und besch\u00e4ftigen und Erlebnissen, die mich gl\u00fccklich machten. Mit mehr Reichweite, kam mehr Privatsph\u00e4re. Der Drang Erinnerungen festzuhalten blieb aber. Nat\u00fcrlich teile ich nach wie vor ausgew\u00e4hlte Momente auf dem Blog, poste Fotos und Videos auf Instagram, kotze mich manchmal auf Twitter aus und zeige Einblicke auf Facebook. Das ist aber nicht alles. Viele Erlebnisse und vor allem Gedanken will man nicht \u00f6ffentlich teilen. Letztes Jahr habe ich damit angefangen Alltagsmomente festzuhalten und sie mit 1 Second Everyday aneinanderzureihen. Ich war ein wenig nachl\u00e4ssig und trotzdem war es sch\u00f6n, ein kleines Tagebuch in Videoform zu haben und beim Betrachten jeden einzelnen Moment wieder zu erleben. Dieses Jahr will ich \u00f6fter daran denken. Meinen Jahresplaner habe ich auch um eine Gedankenzeile erweitert und schreibe nun seit fast drei Wochen zu jedem Tag 1-2 S\u00e4tze dazu. Erfolge, Gef\u00fchle, Entt\u00e4uschungen, sch\u00f6ne Erlebnisse und vieles mehr. Als Minitagebuch sozusagen. Zu guter Letzt will ich auch 2017 wieder mehr Fotos entwickeln. Ich will nicht, dass sie in den Tiefen meines iPhones oder der Festplatte verstauben. Hin und wieder werde ich mit Sicherheit auch wieder Einweg- und Polaroidkameras verwenden, die Erinnerungen vom letztes Jahr waren einmalig. \u00a0 9. Das Bloggen soll nicht mehr in Stress ausarten.  Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob es jedem irgendwann so geht, der den Blog nicht als reines Hobby betreibt, aber ich will so nicht mehr weitermachen. Zu oft hatte ich Phasen, in denen ich mein digitales Zuhause nicht mehr sehen und die ganze Szene meiden wollte. Das Ganze als Last gesehen habe und der Gedanke ans Bloggen einfach nur Druck erzeugt hat. Die vielen sch\u00f6nen Erinnerungen von negativen Gedanken vereinnahmt wurden. Das soll 2017 aufh\u00f6ren. Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, wann die Erkenntnis kam, aber ich wei\u00df, dass ich keine Vollzeitbloggerin sein m\u00f6chte. Ich finde es gro\u00dfartig, was andere in dieser Branche schaffen und machen, aber ich will nicht pausenlos das Werbegesicht f\u00fcr Marken sein, meine Prinzipien ignorieren und mich verbiegen. Ich bin auch einfach nicht genug Selbstdarstellerin. Ich stehe lieber hinter der Kamera und erz\u00e4hle euch von Dingen, die ich mag. Es ist ein Teufelskreis aus dem ich lange nicht hinauskam, ich denke aber, dass ich im letzten Jahr einen guten Weg f\u00fcr mich gefunden habe und diesen auch fortsetzen will. Ich werde mir nicht vornehmen wieder w\u00f6chentlich zu bloggen. Auch wenn das alles bedeutet, dass ich weniger Menschen erreiche und Kooperationen seltener werden. Ich will inspirierende Blogtage mit lieben Menschen ausmachen und weniger perfektionistisch sein. Ich fotografiere wahnsinnig gerne und bin sehr ehrgeizig was das angeht, aber ich will keine Ideen aufgeben, nur weil die Fotos nicht gut genug w\u00e4ren. Au\u00dferdem will ich mir ein Stammlokal zum Schreiben suchen, wenn mir Zuhause wieder die Decke auf den Kopf f\u00e4llt. Mehr zu meinem Blog-Gedankenchaos k\u00f6nnt ihr hier nachlesen. \u00a0 10. Ich will zu meiner Pers\u00f6nlichkeit stehen, aber geduldiger werden. Ich habe nicht vor mir einreden zu lassen, dass Eigenschaften, die ich an mir sch\u00e4tze, vermeintliche Schw\u00e4chen sind. Ich will nicht an mir zweifeln. Ich sollte mich nicht angegriffen f\u00fchlen, wenn mich jemand als bossy bezeichnet oder meint, dass ich zu fordernd bin. Ich mag es, dass ich eine starke Pers\u00f6nlichkeit habe und will mich nicht klein machen lassen. Wie sagte ein Freund k\u00fcrzlich zu mir: \u201eDu bist einfach so ein Go-Getter. Das liebe ich einfach.\u201c Und er hat verdammt noch einmal recht. Damit kommt nicht jeder zurecht, aber das ist auch in Ordnung. Wenn es eine Eigenschaft an mir gibt, die mich aber unglaublich nervt, dann ist es meine Ungeduld. Es f\u00e4llt mir wirklich schwer geduldig zu sein. Egal ob im Beruf, bei Freunden, M\u00e4nnern oder Dingen, die ich mir einfach in den Kopf gesetzt habe. Ich wei\u00df ehrlich gesagt auch nicht genau, wie ich das \u00e4ndern kann, au\u00dfer in Situationen damit konfrontiert zu werden und es dabei immer im Hinterkopf zu behalten. Abwarten.  Wie steht ihr zu Vors\u00e4tzen? Was habt ihr euch vorgenommen?

Dieses Jahr verging so rasend schnell, mit vielen H\u00f6hen und Tiefen. Dinge die ich verdr\u00e4ngte, Erinnerungen an denen ich festhielt, sch\u00f6ne Momente die mich zum lachen brachten, Entscheidungen die ich hinterfragte und noch so viel mehr. In den letzten Tagen befasste ich mich mit den vergangenen Monaten, weil ich nicht nur funktionieren musste, sondern auf einmal viel Zeit hatte. Zeit nachzudenken, das Geschehene zu reflektieren und mir bewusst zu machen, was dieses Jahr f\u00fcr mich bedeutete. Vorgestern pinnte ich wie wild Zitate auf mein privates Pinterest Board. Gestern widmete ich mich einem kleinen Projekt, das mir half mich an viele sch\u00f6ne Momente zu erinnern. Im Fr\u00fchling versuchte ich so oft wie m\u00f6glich ein kurzes Video zu drehen, um am Ende des Jahres einen pers\u00f6nlichen, bewegten R\u00fcckblick zu haben (Stichwort: 1 Second Everyday). Nach wenigen Wochen dr\u00e4ngte ich es in den Hintergrund, bis ich schlie\u00dflich ganz darauf verga\u00df. Gestern versuchte ich allerdings jede noch so kleine Erinnerung einflie\u00dfen zu lassen, nachzudenken was ich alles erlebt habe und f\u00fchlte mich wieder zufriedener. Kennt ihr das, wenn ihr so viel erlebt und durchmacht und gar nicht mehr genau wisst, wie ihr euch dabei gef\u00fchlt habt? Emotionen sind f\u00fcr mich ganz stark an Musik gekn\u00fcpft, an Melodien und Texte und manchmal habe ich das Gef\u00fchl, dass es nur einen Moment und ein Lied braucht, um ganz viele Erinnerungen zur\u00fcckzuholen. Seit gestern h\u00f6re ich meine Playlist des Jahres rauf und runter, die sowohl f\u00fcr unglaubliche Gl\u00fccksgef\u00fchle sorgte, mir aber auch Tr\u00e4nen in die Augen trieb. Am liebsten w\u00fcrde ich all die Geschichten, die in meinem Kopf herumschweben, hier niederschreiben. Wenn das blo\u00df nicht so intim w\u00e4re. Es geht um Euphorie, Momente der Schw\u00e4che, gebrochene Herzen, spannende Abenteuer, Ratlosigkeit, durchtanzte N\u00e4chte und aufflammende Liebesgeschichten. Nichtsdestotrotz m\u00f6chte ich euch einen kleinen Einblick geben. Nicht das gro\u00dfe Ganze, aber zumindest ein paar Lieder, die mir dieses Jahr besonders wichtig waren, die ich wieder entdeckt habe oder die mich nicht loslie\u00dfen. \u201eBehind every favourite song, there is an untold story\u201c, weshalb ich meine ganz pers\u00f6nliche Playlist schlussendlich untold stories 2016 genannt habe. Da sind Lieder, die mich daran erinnern, wie spannend das Jahr anfing. Eine wilde Zeit, die schon viel zu weit weg scheint, dank der ich aber meine Liebe f\u00fcr Indiesongs wieder entdeckte. Als ich meinen Entschluss best\u00e4rkte Dinge zu tun, die ich liebe und deshalb auch wieder auf mehr Konzerte ging. Das kitschigste zweite Date, das zu gut in einen Independent-Liebesfilm gepasst h\u00e4tte. Die Phase, als mein Liebeskummer so gro\u00df war und ich froh war so wunderbare Menschen um mich zu haben. Der Konzertfr\u00fchling, gefolgt von vielen Reisen unter anderem nach Berlin. Ein Fr\u00fchsommer, der viele Freundschaften st\u00e4rkte. Sch\u00f6ne Zuf\u00e4lle und die vorsichtigen Versuche einander n\u00e4her zu kommen, unterbrochen von noch mehr Reisen. Lieder, die mich an einen gro\u00dfartigen Sommer und vor allem an mein erstes Festival im Ausland erinnern. Bis hin zu einer vertrauten und ruhigen kalten Jahreszeit.   Welche Lieder habt ihr dieses Jahr besonders oft geh\u00f6rt? Womit verbindet ihr besondere Erinnerungen? The post Wenn 2016 ein Soundtrack w\u00e4re.

She is so beautiful and an amazing business woman. I\u2019ve actually talked about Allie before when I discussed the artist who showed me how she could use filler to completely rid me of my under eye bags. Life changing I tell ya! I also recently had her try a little volume in my lips, super subtle so it wouldn\u2019t be a huge difference (especially requested by Nick because he\u2019s very vigilant about me looking like me:) I\u2019ve really liked the smidge of extra volume! I know it bothers some to hear about people doing that kind of thing and some feel like it\u2019s too vain or crosses the line. I just don\u2019t feel that way. Certainly anyone can go overboard with vanity, materialism and self centeredness. I just don\u2019t think this one thing is the indicator of that. I was distracted by my baggy under eyes in the morning, if I took a selfie and often when I sat in front of the mirror to do my makeup. I bought all the creams and slathered them on hoping for a change that never much came. Then one day a few years ago I got an injection and guess what? I have not thought about those pesky under eye bags a single time since! I think that\u2019s pretty fun! On the other hand I know it comes with its own set of risks and it can be overdone and look unnatural in some cases so if others are not on board I am more than supportive of that choice. Everyone gets to make their own decisions based on what they are comfortable with. I was grateful for the open and honest women who told me about it, so I feel like I should return the favor. Anyway, back to Allie:) After all these years we finally decided it was time for her to get in the chair so I could try my hand at making up her gorgeous face. I often tell my makeovers to come as they are, I don\u2019t like for all of my before and afters to be completely without makeup vs. full makeup. For instance if you have a natural blonde, they are going to look much different without mascara, but everyone knows about mascara so it feels like cheating and when that is stealing the show it makes it harder to see the differences the other techniques can create  What I used \u2013 Skin \u0026 Cheeks: IIID Foundation in amber + ash + desert sunset + rose gold Brows: Anastasia Brow pencil in Dark Brown Eyes: Shadows from the Every Single Day palette | lid and around the bottom lashes \u2013 oak + in the crease \u2013 finn + to deepen the bottom and top lash line \u2013 salem Fales Lashes Esqido A Lash Named Desire Lips: Lipsense Lined the lips with Nude + 1 layer of nude + 1 layer of Apple Cider + 1 Layer of bravo (in the middle of the lips and on the cupids bow) Glossy Gloss over top.

Man, it\u2019s been a rough year out there. For so many people for so many reasons. But\u2026in the last few weeks I\u2019ve seen something happening around me. I\u2019ve seen so many people realizing that knowing the world isn\u2019t fair, knowing that our leaders are flawed, knowing that people around us are hurting\u2026that all of that knowledge can do more than just make our hearts ache and our blood boil. It can inspire us to ACT. To stop relying on anything or anyone else to make it better. That complaining about the darkness isn\u2019t working and our only chance to beat it is with light. Our own light. And what more perfect season than this one for this change to begin?  25 ways in 25 days is a Christmas Advent Calendar of action and service, inspired by Christ to keep Him in our hearts everyday this month.

You heard it right, for the next three, yes, THREE full days I am home, with no suitcase in tow and no vlogging camera surgically attached to my hand. Glorious. I don\u0027t have any of my Fashion Week content ready to grace your eyes yet, so today I thought I\u0027d just catch you up on where life is at and what\u0027s going on. February has been the most incredible month, so much so I can\u0027t quite comprehend just how great things are and I\u0027m feeling seriously #blessed. I hate that hashtag more often than not, but seriously it\u0027s the most relevant right now. NEW YORK My work with TRESemm\u00e9 on their #WorkIt campaign in the earlier half of this month ended up taking me to New York City to experience NYFW with them and get a feel for their hair looks backstage and in their NYFW pop up. Experiences like this really do blow my mind and I loved the experience. I stepped up to my fear of heights and got one of my all time favourite instagram images at the top of the Empire State Building, visited the Glossier showroom and sat front row at Jenny Packham - how could I forget that one? Most amazingly of all, I was anxiety free for both plane journeys, whilst that might not mean a lot to some people, for me this is a huge deal and I came away from the entire trip beaming with pride and feeling so happy that my CBT sessions over the past six months really have started to pay off. Not only do I feel proud, I feel stronger for it, and I know I can overcome what ever life throws at me if I put my mind to it. LONDON A couple of days after setting my feet back on UK soil, my suitcase was packed again, this time for London Fashion Week. I stayed at the Sanderson Hotel (one I would highly recommended and will most likely stay there for over Fashion Week in future), sat front row at Topshop and worked with them on a live stream of the show via my insta stories, I also attended the Muberry and Temperly shows, both of which I adore and it felt like a total dream to see three of my all time favourite shows all in the space of a few hours. I also worked with the Este\u00e9 Edit, a brand I LOVE and will be doing a post on soon because I\u0027ve discovered a few incredible new products from them. It all ended on Tuesday night at the Naked Heart Foundation Fund Fair, which is a jaw dropping-ly gorgeous event for a great cause. It\u0027s something I always feel very grateful to have the opportunity to attend as it really is completely magical. PARIS? And then we have Paris. I have three days at home before I pack up my things and head off to Paris for something totally magical. I\u0027ve been invited by one of my favourite brands, and rest assured I\u0027ll have my vlogging camera surgically attached to my hand once again! It also won\u0027t be my last trip to the gorgeous city this month either... And there you have it, February in a nut shell. Of course, jet lag from earlier in the month has finally hit me now I\u0027m no longer all \u0022go go go\u0022 so I\u0027m looking forward to taking the next few days to regroup and re-evaluate. But I\u0027m feeling so incredibly blessed and grateful for every opportunity this month, I am literally beaming. With taking just a little step back to reflect and look forward, I can already feel my creative brain starting to whirl again as I plan my content for this month. I really do feel like my content is finally coming together right now and this will be the year I create some really fun new videos. So without further ado, I\u0027m going to turn the La La Land soundtrack off, wrap this up, and get on with that.\u00a0 Until next time... x    JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

Valentines Day, love it or hate it, it\u2019s coming. Each year my feelings towards it ebbs and flows, some years it feels like we could all really do without another hallmark holiday, I mean, if you love someone you let them know everyday right? But other years I\u2019m all for it. Yes we should all show our loved ones how special they are all the time, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to have a day dedicated to spending that little bit of extra time with them. I think right now with the state of the world (because who actually enjoys reading their twitter news feed anymore?) a lot more of us are seizing any opportunity to spread a little love. And I\u2019m all for that.\u00a0 So whilst the 14th February isn\u2019t all about the gifts (I currently have our living room covered in red heart balloons and roses, with a lovely evening planned upon my return from New York - it can be more about the experience than the act of just giving) I thought I\u2019d put together a few ideas for gifts, just in case you\u2019re thinking of purchasing last minute something for a friend or partner.    BEAUTYTo start off, you can\u0027t go wrong with a gift from Lush. They have such a huge range of products to suit a lot of preferences and they don\u0027t break the bank too much. Their Lover Lamp bath bomb is one that I\u0027m obsessed with at the moment - seriously, my six piece collection is quickly dwindling and I\u0027ll be all out before the month is up - it\u0027s not too over powering and is a subtle but luxurious addition to your bath. Then we have the Diptique Rosamundi candle, which lured me in by it\u0027s packaging alone, but the Rose scent it carries is utterly gorgeous. If you\u0027re looking for a little makeup with a wonderfully romantic feel, Dior have just launched their new shades of the Dior Addict Lip Glow - a line of lip balms with beautifully moisturising finish, a delicious vanilla scent and shades that range from rosy pinks and peach to more deep pink\/berry shades.\u00a0  JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content. For my other half I can\u0027t go wrong with picking up a fresh tub of his favourite moisturiser and adding a new fragrance to his collection. The new Jo Malone, Mehr and Tonka is one of those perfectly uni sex fragrance that you could buy for your partner and always end up stealing for yourself. It\u0027s a win-win gift either way. FASHION When it comes to clothing, this area is a little tricky to navigate. I always go for a super soft sweater from the Reiss Mens section as my gift of choice, but you could also opt for a timeless jacket from Allsaints (budget permitting but Topman have some amazing alternatives too). In the past Vans and a new watch have also never gone unloved. For me, gifts that I\u0027ve always loved are timeless or have a little more of an everyday luxury feel. Slogan Sweaters from Whistles are always a winner, whilst my Alex Monroe Bumble Bee and Monica Vinader Rings and Bracelets are so loved too. For something a little less everyday but still so special, the Dior Tribal earrings are a beautiful piece if you want something that feels really indulgent - a modern twist on the classic pearl earring, they can be worn day and night but also styled with different jewellery. I got mind over Christmas and fell head over heels for them. But of course, if you\u0027re looking for something incredible, or you just fancy treating yourself come payday, a gorgeous pair of heels, whether from ASOS or Aquazurra, are always a good idea.  JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser. Reactivate it to view this content.  OTHER If your giftee isn\u0027t a huge fashion or beauty hoarder, don\u0027t worry. Stores like Oliver Bonas have the most gift-able stock on planet earth right now. Their little pink pillows are perfect for someone who likes their interiors to look cozy (with a little fuzzy added in), whilst their crystal book ends are a gorgeous gift for someone who has too many books or is always on the hunt for a unique coffee table ornament. If you want to approach this kind of gift from a more holistic angle, O.B also have a huge selection of books you could wrap up too! They also have a tonne of tiny trinkets, their little cat dish for example is practical, whilst still remaining utterly adorable, and don\u0027t even get me started on their Valentines Day cards. If you take anything from this post, it\u0027s the recommendation of buying your card from there. They have so many designs from brilliantly funny to super cute and heart felt and I actually ended up purchasing a couple of options depending on my mood come next Tuesday. My personal favourite being one that reads \u0022don\u0027t go bacon ma heart\u0022 with a little frying pan filled with bacon. Genius.\u00a0  JavaScript is currently disabled in this browser.

I love enjoying the moment and not needing to think about whether my hair\u0027s running wild. With Valentines Day (and New York Fashion Week) just around the corner, I\u0027ve been perfecting my go to look to make them the most effortless with the most hold possible. Think \u0022I just woke up like this... but all day long. I think I\u0027ve pretty much got the routine down now. Just in time considering I leave for New York with TRESemm\u00e9 in less than 48 hours (HOW EXCITING!!!) and I\u0027ve complied my favourite no fuss, minimal maintenance hair styles in to one tutorial for you...   THE WAVESThis look is all about looking effortless, with minimal product involvement. It\u0027s textured, messy and a little rough around the edges which makes the time old clich\u00e9 of bouncy curls a little more modern. It sits somewhere between effortless french girl hair and California babe waves. Don\u0027t ask me exactly where, as I haven\u0027t quite decided, but it\u0027s somemwhere on the scale... Prep tip:\u00a0 For extra hold to your hairstyle use the TRESemm\u00e9 Volume \u0026 Life Mousse after washing your hair (pre blow dry) to give your curls the extra hold they need. The Volume \u0026 Life Mousse\u00a0Adds long-lasting fullness and weightless feeling to your hair without leaving it too crisp\u00a0or sticky    THE HOW TO: Pin It:\u00a0Pin two thirds of your hair over the top of your head. Protect: Project your hair! Today I\u0027m using the TRESemm\u00e9 Heat Defence Styling Spray which protects your hair from damage caused by\u00a0heat styling. It also leaves your hair feeling soft, with a sheen that would have you believe I don\u0027t use heat on it daily. Repeat with each section. Curl: Curl from the root of your hair, leaving a section loose at the end. This will leave your finished wave looking a little more undone. Curl different sized sections of hair to give the waves a more natural look. Repeat with each section.\u00a0 Fix:\u00a0I set my curls with TRESemm\u00e9 Extra Hold Hairspray.\u00a0This gives maximum hold with a fast drying finish, leaving hair\u00a0feeling naturally soft - perfect for keeping your easy, effortless waves in place! \u0026 Repeat: Repeat previous steps with each section and back comb the roots and mid lengths of the final section of hair a little to give more body and shape.

The Chanel Rouge Allure Ink\u0027s were released back in September and I quickly fell head over heels in love with them, so I thought it about time they had their own spotlight on hello-october.com. Don\u0027t you agree? Let\u0027s get one thing settled before we start this review. These are not the dry matte formula you associate with a liquid lipstick. In fact, these have entirely changed my preference when it comes to a liquid lipstick. I no longer reach for those with a matte finish, but those with a velvet feel, and my lips have well and truly thanked me for it. Despite not being 100% matte, these lipsticks still fall in to the afore mentioned category as they do dry down to a matte looking finish. However the feel is anything but. They\u0027re comfortable and don\u0027t feel dry at all, and last for a good few hours without the need for a touch up. I say a good few hours because, let\u0027s get real, I eat at least every four hours and drink frequently. So naturally most lip products on the market don\u0027t get past this wear time with me. And then we have the colour range. Whilst there isn\u0027t a vast selection of colours, the eight in the range are all gorgeous and there\u0027s a little something for everybody. There are even a few reds which allows us a better chance at finding our perfect rouge tone in the collection.\u00a0 My personal favourite shades are the lightest and darkest of the collection, Amoureux (a nude, rosey pink) and Exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 (a gorgeous dark red). I wear both on a daily basis and will happily repurchase them once I\u0027ve used both up. And if Chanel do decide to expand the shade range in the collection I will be first in line at my local counter to purchase. They\u0027re that good. SIDE NOTE: These are limited edition, but you can still get them online and I\u0027ve seen them on a few counters so they\u0027re worth giving a swatch if you spot them! SHOP.

I literally could save twenty pounds in the weight of my suitcase if I wasn\u2019t so obsessed with lipstick. And I love the look of a gloss, but not a big fan of the goopiness of it. So lip oils have been my favorite discovery of the last year. And especially tinted ones! They are mega moisturizing but not sticky or thick. They\u2019re actually really thin but equally as shiny. They are all I want to wear right now. I like to wear them over a lip liner because even though they\u2019re tinted, they\u2019re sheer.

Today I am sharing with you what\u2019s in my skincare closet. All of these products below are ones that I highly recommend. I would not be sharing it with you if I haven\u2019t had a positive experience with each and every one of them. Now, take a look for yourself!  Origins Face Wash \u2013 my favorite face wash EVER \u2014 it balances dry and oily skin (which I have), and smells like peppermint. I have been using this for a couple years now and am constantly restocking! Shiseido Sunscreen \u2013 I never leave the house without applying sunscreen\u2026.ever. And this is one of my favorite sunscreens. I switch out between this or Clarins Sunscreen. Tatcha Cleansing Oil \u2013 Cleansing oil has changed my life! This one in particular does the job and gets rid of all my makeup, without having to use a makeup wipe. If you haven\u2019t tried cleansing oil yet, you must try this. Clinique Moisturizing Gel \u2013 I have oily skin so this the perfect moisturizer for my skin type. I have been using this one for years.  Fresh Sugar Polish \u2013 First, this face scrub mask smells amazing. Second, this makes your face feeling SO smooth and rejuvenated. Huxley Anti-Gravity Cream \u2013 I discovered this face cream when I went to my local Nordstrom in LA and saw a pop-up dedicated to Korean beauty \u2014 but don\u2019t worry, you can purchase this online too! I\u2019ve been using this a lot lately and absolutely love it. It makes my skin feel new in the morning, AND it smells amazing. Glossier Moisturizing Mask \u2013 My roommate gifted this to me and I use it whenever my skin is dry and needs a pick-me-up. This works like MAGIC. Caudalie Detox Oil \u2013 I apply this almost every night and it revives my skin come the morning. I can\u2019t get enough of it and I\u2019m ready to go on to my 3rd bottle!  Mario Badescu Face Spray \u2013 I\u2019m sure everyone has seen this product before but the hype is real guys! I use this all the time. Caudalie Moisturizing Toner \u2013 This moisturizing toner has been saving my life this winter. I immediately apply this after I wash my face. Origins Renewal Serum \u2013 I apply this several times a week at night and I loveeeee. I think I just love the Origins brand in general (as you can tell in this post ha!)  Origins Rose Clay Mask \u2013 This has been one of my favorite Origins face masks (see #2 below too). Origins Charcoal Clay Mask \u2013 So good for cleaning out your pores \u2014 this is another one of my favorite Origins mask. Origins Night-A-Mins Cream \u2013 Can you tell I love the Origins brand? I promise this post is NOT sponsored by Origins (ha!) but this is another fave night cream (which I had to patiently wait for on backorder because it apparently is a hot-selling item\u2026but I understand why). Vant Instant Recovery Mask \u2013 This is a mask I picked up at the Korean Beauty pop-up in Nordstrom in LA but as I mentioned before, Nordstrom sells this online too! I used this the other day and LOVE how it made my skin feel fresh and soft. What are some of your favorite skincare products that you use on a daily basis? I\u2019m SO into skincare so please, please share them in the comments below! xx Eunice","date":"1487690556","title":"SKINCARE FAVES.","media":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2017\/02\/TBDFace1.jpg","num_loves":"80","num_saves":"58","num_comments":"0","post_tags":["skincare","night cream","serum","skin"],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x507","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2017\/02\/TBDFace1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRjk3Ljc0LjY1LjE2MiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzLWMlMkYyMDE3JTJGMDIlMkZUQkRGYWNlMS5qcGc=?checksum=72eb242ce66ce49c213ec15cd53b7f25ce220e20\u0026format=h"}},"name":"the beauty department","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=5466430731\u0026blog=2521588\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=blog_profile","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2521588\/5466430731","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/skincare-faves-5466430731","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/skincare-faves-5466430731","likes":138},"5464367739:2521588":{"post_id":"5464367739","blog_id":"2521588","link":"http:\/\/thebeautydepartment.com\/2017\/02\/favorite-highlighting-technique\/","content":"TUTORIAL + PHOTOGRAPHY BY AMY NADINE, GRAPHIC DESIGN BY EUNICE CHUN  I\u2019ve noticed since Strobing became really popular, well, let\u2019s just say people have gotten a little excited and might be overdoing it a little.

Enter: Korean face mask sheets. Each sheet is soaked in powerful ingredients made to hydrate and elevate your skin\u2019s health. Over the last couple of years, Korean face mask sheets have become increasingly popular, in demand, and in turn, more accessible. Nowadays, you can find face mask sheets in Sephora, Target, and even Forever 21. Face mask sheets have become a part of my skincare routine 1-2 times a week. My mom hooked me into face mask sheets years ago. It is such an easy and simple way of hydrating and revitalizing your skin. Just wash your face thoroughly, lay in bed, and apply this face mask sheet and let it soak in for 15-20 mins. I do this before I go to bed, so by the morning my face feels fresh and hydrated. Below are some face mask sheets I highly recommend: Dr. Jart+ Water Replenishment Mask \u2013 used to hydrate the skin and improve redness and\/or dryness BioMiracle Vitamin C Collagen Mask \u2013 used to brighten and hydrate the skin (my mom bulk ordered a huge pack of these for me and I love, love, love this mask sheet) Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Mask \u2013 used to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! Peach + Lily Drench + Nourish Mask \u2013 used to hyrdrate and feed your skin vitamins and antioxidants Leaders Aloe Soothing Mask \u2013 used to hydrate and calm\/relieve tired or stressed skin  Other places I like to buy Korean face mask sheets are at The Face Shop (a Korean beauty store*) and Peach \u0026 Lily (a Korean beauty e-commerce shop). (P.S. The face mask sheets pictured in the opening photo are from The Face Shop) *So, The Face Shop currently does not have a US website but they have brick + mortar stores throughout the US. Some are in New York, Maryland, Virginia, California\u2026 Do a Google search to see if one is nearby you! Have you guys used face mask sheets before? Let me know, and have a wonderful weekend! xx Eunice","date":"1486742332","title":"FACE IT.","media":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2017\/02\/TBDFaceMasks2.jpg","num_loves":40,"num_saves":18,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":["skincare","face mask","face mask sheets","face masks","korean face mask","korean skincare"],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x720","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/97.74.65.162\/wp-content\/uploads-c\/2017\/02\/TBDFaceMasks2.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRjk3Ljc0LjY1LjE2MiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzLWMlMkYyMDE3JTJGMDIlMkZUQkRGYWNlTWFza3MyLmpwZw==?checksum=e3e7159a3d200d1ba41ec7c8073584d272c26c5c\u0026format=h"}},"name":"the beauty department","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=5444508149\u0026blog=2521588\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=blog_profile","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/2521588\/5444508149","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/face-it-5444508149","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/beauty-department-2521588\/face-it-5444508149","likes":58},"5480375923:7656413":{"post_id":"5480375923","blog_id":"7656413","link":"http:\/\/www.esteelalonde.com\/february-newsletter\/","content":"FEBRUARY NEWSLETTER  WATCH THE VLOG!

I remember buying my first ever Chanel lipstick and being too scared to use it for fear of ruining its sheer beauty. There\u2019s something about Chanel that feels so luxurious and special; the kind of makeup that you save for special occasions and feel like royalty when you use it. To me, using Chanel makeup always feels like such a treat, so I\u2019m so excited to tell you guys about some of the new products that I was lucky enough to receive.  Chanel Rouge Coco Gloss These glosses are truly gorgeous. The thing I like about the Rouge Coco Glosses is that the formula is ultra-light and non sticky, which means that it barely feels like I have any product on my lips at all. Enriched with Coconut Oil and Vitamin E, the formula is also really kind to your lips and helps to nourish and moisturise throughout the day. I\u2019m not really into glitter glosses, so I\u2019ll probably give the shimmery shades to someone that I know will love and wear them. However the shade \u2018Douceur\u2019 (the gorgeous peachy, coral colour) is absolutely beautiful and works perfectly with my pale complexion. I have a feeling that Douceur will look perfect paired with sunkissed skin during the summer months.  Another thing that I like about these glosses is the dual sided applicator because it really helps me to get an even coverage. I like to use the rounded side of the applicator for my top lip because it helps me to get a really precise finish on my cupids bow and the curved side of the applicator for my bottom lip. I like to wear one of these glosses on its own but you can also layer it over a lipstick to add depth and shine to your colour.  Chanel Coco Code Blush Harmony How cute is this compact!? I couldn\u2019t resist snapping a pic as soon as I saw it! This is the Chanel Coco Code Blush Harmony and I have to say it\u2019s gorgeous! This compact contains four shades of product which you can either mix together and use as one or apply individually. Personally I like to sweep my brush over all four shades and apply to my cheeks for a super gorgeous radiant effect. After I\u2019ve applied my blush I\u2019ll use the lightest shade as a highlighter and dust it onto the tops of my cheekbones and under the arch of my eyebrows, doing this gives a really natural finish and a subtle luminosity which I love! You guys know I\u2019m all about that glow. Chanel Les 4 Ombres Multi-Effect Quadra Eyeshadow Ok guys, I\u2019m in love with these shades. This eyeshadow palette is ideal for when I\u2019m on the go because it has all the shades I need; two medium tones, a darker shadow to sculpt and the lightest shade to highlight. I\u2019m really into warm, gold tones so these four shades are everything I could ever wish for. Gorgeous! Chanel Joues Contraste Powder Blush This blush is beautiful The powder itself is super silky and soft and really helps to soften my makeup look by giving me a natural looking glow. It\u2019s totally buildable so I tend to apply a light dusting and see what it looks like, if I feel like I need a bit more colour I\u2019ll sweep my brush back into the product and dust my cheeks again.  Chanel Le Rouge Crayon De Couleur  I\u2019m a huge lover of lip crayons and that\u2019s because I find this kind of product super easy to apply. I\u2019m all about stress-free makeup and pretty much adore any product that saves me time and effort in front of the mirror. The Chanel Le Rouge Crayons do exactly that. These crayons are wonderful; they\u2019re great to keep in your handbag and apply the go because they\u2019re so simple to use. They\u2019re retractable so they\u2019re ideal for when you\u2019re going to be out and about all day; there\u2019s no stress when topping up your lip colour, just a swipe and you\u2019re good to go. The crayons come in a huge array of beautiful shades, everything from a gorgeous deep berry colour to the perfect summery coral and subtle nude. Lately I\u2019ve been loving the shade \u2018Cassis\u2019 because its the perfect winter shade and works well when I\u2019m wearing a darker outfit. If you\u2019re all about no-stress makeup then definitely check out the Chanel Le Rouge Crayon De Couleurs, I love these babies!    Chanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour In my opinion you can never have too many Chanel nail polishes in your collection! There\u2019s something about a simple slick of something Chanel that makes me feel like the epitome of chic and these Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colours are no exception. How gorgeous are these colours? It\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll find me with anything other than nude or red polish on my nails but these babies have already tempted me to stray away from my usual colour choices. The formula of these polishes has been newly renovated so that it improves the quality and strength of your nails which is perfect for me since my nails can tend to get quite brittle. If I had to pick a favourite product out of all the beautiful Chanel pieces that I\u2019ve acquired recently I\u2019d probably say the Chanel Coco Code Blush Harmony is the one I love the most! Let me know if you\u2019ve tried any of these Chanel products. Which ones are your favourites?

It\u2019s not often that I get to glam up and spend hours getting ready, which is why it was so fun for me! BAFTA weekend consists of lots of activities leading up to a pre-party on Saturday night at Kensington Palace (no biggie) and then the actual BAFTA ceremony is on Sunday evening. Make sure you watch the video at the bottom of this post if you\u2019d like to see exactly what I got up to! Buy this sequin top! Here\u2019s the skirt to match! Here\u2019s what I wore to the pre-party\u2026lots and lots of sequins! I wanted to wear something fun and a little more interesting than my usual outfits (jeans and t-shirts everyday). I absolutely love sequins and to be completely covered in them was so much fun. I got so many compliments on this outfit and I felt fantastic! I also amped up my makeup with a dark smokey eye and loads of loads of mascara! I was in complete awe when the makeup artist used the Lanc\u00f4me Grandi\u00f4se Extreme Mascara on me. It was genuinely better than false lashes\u2026if you like big lashes you need this in your life! I also decided to rock a bold red lip because I wanted to try out the new ~matte~ Juicy Shakers which will be launching next month! I was so impressed by how long lasting it was. Even after an evening of talking, laughing and having dinner it stayed put! More on those later though\u2026 Also, how stunning is that wall of roses?  Buy this red dress here. For the red carpet evening I decided to wear a red floor length gown. I was slightly panicked because the day before this event I still hadn\u2019t figured out what to wear but luckily my ASOS order came through! As soon as I put it on I felt comfortable and confident in it. I was also really lucky that the length was perfect because I\u2019m quite short and long dresses usually drag on the floor. I wore my favourite black heels and the black Chloe Drew bag, which held my camera, makeup and anything else I thought I\u2019d need. I\u2019m not a huge fan of clutch bags so I thought this would be perfect to use for more glam events like this one, but I can also use it in my regular life. I decided to go quite natural on the makeup with the Lanc\u00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Long Wear Foundation, which is matte but also has a glow to it to create a flawless base. A bit of bronzer, eyebrows and loads of mascara and that was pretty much it! Oh and I also wore the Lanc\u00f4me Shine Lover Lipstick in the shade 218! Such a classic shade.  Huge thank you to my Lanc\u00f4me family for bringing me along and allowing me to have such a fantastic experience. It was truly unforgettable!

Not to mention the fact that she\u2019s an all-round wonderful human being and a real GEM to have in my life! I wanted to put together a blog post all about something that Ingrid has been working so hard on for quite a while now and I\u2019m so excited to tell you guys all about it! Ingrid has partnered with bareMinerals to bring us a collection of three of her most favourite illuminating bareMinerals products. The collection is GORGEOUS and contains everything you\u2019ll ever need to create the perfect glowing base for any makeup look.  The collection includes one of the Original Broad Spectrum SPF 15 Foundations, a limited edition Invisible Glow Highlighter, a limited edition Beautiful Finish Brush and of course this cute makeup bag-Ingrid picked some real gems! They\u2019re all wonderful in their own right and when you use them together they create the perfect base for whatever makeup look you\u2019re going for. Limited-Edition Invisible Glow Highlighter You guys know that I\u2019m all about that glow, so this limited edition Invisible Glow Highlighter is perfect for me! Ingrid developed this product in a shade that is guaranteed to flatter all skin tones, so don\u2019t fret if you\u2019re wondering whether this highlighter will work with your skin. I\u2019m a bit of a highlighter hoarder and this one is definitely going to be a permanent fixture in my collection.I use a brush to pick up some of the product before sweeping it over the tops of my cheekbones, I also like to dab some under the arch of my eyebrows, on the tip of my nose and in my cupids bow. This stuff is gorgeous, you need it in your life!  Original Foundation Broad Spectrum SPF 15 This foundation is simply gorgeous! I hardly ever reach for a mineral foundation these days, but using this reminded me why I used to wear mineral makeup religiously. It\u2019s designed to give your skin a flawless coverage with a super lightweight, bare skin feel (which as you guys know, I LOVE). What I really like about this foundation is that it\u2019s super buildable and although it looks like a powder it actually feels like a cream on your skin, so you can build it up without looking super cakey. It\u2019s enriched with SPF 15 which helps to shield your skin from the sun\u2019s rays and prevents any damage from becoming visible on your face. This stuff is super easy to apply, all I do is pick up some of the product onto a brush and tap off any excess before buffing it into my skin. I like to start from the centre of my face and work my way outwards in circular motions. This foundation gives my skin a subtle coverage and a natural looking glow. I love it!  Limited-Edition Beautiful Finish Brush First of all, can we just talk about how super cute this brush is? I wish you guys could feel the bristles through the screen because it\u2019s pretty much the softest brush I\u2019ve ever felt, it\u2019s beautiful! The Beautiful Finish Brush has been designed to fit perfectly into the Bare Minerals Original Foundation lids so its the ideal tool to use to apply your Broad Spectrum Foundation. Whenever I use this brush I actually notice a difference in the way the foundation looks on my skin, its wide handle means that it\u2019s easy to control and allows you to get a really even application. Make sure you get your hands on one of these gorgeous limited edition makeup sets! I absolutely love each and every one of the products that Ingrid has chosen to include in the collection and I know that you will too. Let me know which of the three products is your favourite by commenting down below. Huge congratulations to Ingrid for working so hard and launching this amazing collection!

Goud is eigenlijk altijd goed! Het flatteert bijna elke oogkleur, past bij elke outfit en is neutraal, maar wel met een beetje extra glans. Ik heb dan ook een flinke verzameling goudtinten, maar ik zoek altijd door. Toen ik bij Tati van Glamlifeguru de prachtige Peripera Wholly Deep Jewel Pot in Be Edge zag was ik meteen verliefd. Die geweldige gouden oogschaduw moest ik hebben! Laat zijn ietwat saaie uitstraling je niet misleiden; dit is echt een stunner. Peripera is een Koreaans merk dat ik eigenlijk nog niet zo goed kende, maar de laatste tijd wel steeds vaker voorbij zie komen. Het valt onder het concern Clio, dat sowieso goed bekend staat om hun goede make-up. De Wholly Deep Jewel Pots zijn prachtige oogschaduws die me enorm doen denken aan de L\u2019Or\u00e9al Infaillable Eye Shadows. Het zijn namelijk meer een soort geperste pigmenten die extreem veel kleur afgeven. Tel daar een flinke dosis glitters bij op en je hebt een (letterlijk) schitterend product. Peripera Wholly Deep Jewel Pot in Be Edge De kleur die ik heb, Be Edge is een vrij neutrale goudtint. Niet te oranje en zeker niet te zilver.

Because I think that the initial hormonal changes actually make my skin worse and then things level out in the second and third trimesters \u2013 I am convinced that it\u2019s all of the little skincare habits I tend to adopt that make the most difference. Here are some of the skincare habits I adopt during pregnancy that I believe make a considerable difference to my face \u2013 I\u2019m really trying to hang on to these little changes, because I love that fresh-faced, blemish-free, even-toned pregnancy glow! Alcohol. I realise that \u201cnot drinking too much alcohol\u201d isn\u2019t a skincare habit, per se, but it\u2019s definitely a biggie for me \u2013 I haven\u2019t had a proper drink (ie, been tipsy) in about two and a half years now and my skin is definitely brighter and healthier-looking for it. I don\u2019t think that I have a wonderful tolerance for alcohol \u2013 I used to suffer with massively disproportionate hangovers! \u2013 and so it only takes a couple of glasses of red wine for me to look like a hag the next day. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m never going to drink again (HAHA chance would be a fine thing) but I\u2019ve definitely broken that cycle of regular evening\u2026self-medication. My skin has far less off days, my dark circles are less pronounced and I\u2019m sure that the redness I used to get around my nose and on my chin has greatly diminished. SPF. I\u2019m rather haphazard with my SPF use in the non-summer UK months \u2013 if I\u2019m outdoors or on holiday then I slather it on like there\u2019s no tomorrow, but otherwise I rely on the incidental sort of coverage you get from BB creams or what have you. However when pregnant, I get paranoid about the increased risk of pigmentation patches and spots and so if I was out and about I always used an SPF. (Latest find \u2013 and I love this \u2013 is the BareMinerals Prep Step, here.) I think that as a result my skin is more even in tone after pregnancy. Yes, it\u2019s paler, and I do like a bit of a sunkissed hue, but it\u2019s nothing that a spot of Hylamide Glow can\u2019t fix.  Antioxidants. Continuing with my pigmentation paranoia: I like to add an antioxidant into my routine as an extra layer of protection against the environment and UV rays. I use a serum high in antioxidants and just slip it on before moisturiser or SPF. Paula\u2019s Choice do a good one here, I also like this from Caudalie a lot and if you\u2019ve got a load of cash to flash then look to SkinCeuticals and Zelens for state-of-the-art skin protection. Gentle Products. My skin is usually more sensitive during pregnant and so I step away, mostly, from daily use of acid exfoliants. I think that there\u2019s a massive temptation to overuse acids and I\u2019ve realised from years of experimentation that they are better (for me, at least) used just once or twice a week. I know that some people like the drastic results and don\u2019t mind the fallout (reactions, peeling, spots, etc) that can happen with very active products, but I\u2019m all for keeping my skin on an even keel. I\u2019ve found that treating it kindly gets great results \u2013 I like a strong mask or peel or overnight treatment, but I\u2019ve learnt to dial it all down a bit. (I like the FAB pads for non-drastic acid exfoliation, and also Pai do an AHA mask that doesn\u2019t make your face fall off, if you want gentle-but-effective.) Oils. I use far more oils (both cleansing and moisturising) during pregnancy, and it\u2019s a little ritual I\u2019d like to keep. Though I now have far less time to do a \u201croutine\u201d, it\u2019s nice just to spend a few minutes massaging the skin and getting the circulation going. There are dozens and dozens of amazing face oils, but I like the L\u2019Oreal Rebalancing Oil for temperamental\/spotty skin days, MV Organic Skincare Rose Booster for calming down temperamental and dry, tight skin and Darphin\u2019s little bottles of oil as a proper treat after having a bath. The Tangerine one is an all-time favourite. What\u2019s not so good about my skin during pregnancy? It feels dry, tight and my fine lines are definitely more visible. I have to battle really hard to keep my skin (and body) hydrated, which is a theme that seems to continue post-partum and during the breastfeeding months, hence the oils added in (above) and my obsession with thirst-quenching creams and lotions.

Oh my lord. It\u2019s very good \u2013 very good. It\u2019s sort of a cross between an incredibly dark and violent Dickens story and something bleak and hopeless and beautiful, like, I don\u2019t know, The Piano. The art direction is amazing, the plot is weird-but-interesting, the costumes and the sets completely capture everything that London in the year 1814 would have been. Stinking, dangerous, dimly-lit\u2026 And then there\u2019s Tom Hardy. Now look. I do happen to think \u2013 and I say this without any hint of irony \u2013 that Hardy is one of the best, most immensely talented actors of our time. I\u2019d like to point that out first, because the following list reduces him to something of a nightshirt-wearing tattooed Sex God. All tongue-in-cheek, of course, but I\u2019d hate for anyone to think that I\u2019d ignored his actual skills\u2026  In Taboo, Hardy plays the disturbed James Delaney who returns from a long spell in Africa to inherit his father\u2019s shipping empire. Now this man, Delaney, is everything unsexy that you could possibly think of. He\u2019s always covered in horse poo or blood or weird magical powders \u2013 he looks dirty, I mean really dirty, and he has previously had many sessions of sexytime with his own sister. So, y\u2019know, by all rights this is not a character we should be even remotely attracted to. But then it\u2019s Tom Hardy, and Tom Hardy was even sexy as Bane, the psychopathic masked baddie in Batman, so why is it even a surprise that he can make ingrained dirt and nineteenth-century sewer smells into a bonus attribute? Here\u2019s my list of things that only Tom Hardy can make sexy \u2013 I\u2019m limiting this to things in Taboo, otherwise we\u2019d be here all bloody year\u2026 Mumbling: I swear I can only hear three out of every ten words that James Delaney says, but who the hell cares? Hardy could read out the Argos catalogue and it\u2019d still be hot. Killing: shouldn\u2019t be sexy, especially when it involves hacking through a ribcage to retrieve a heart, and especially when it takes place at the \u201coutdoor lavatories\u201d (imagine the smell!), but he has such a fabulous look on his face when he\u2019s concentrating. And I reckon, in a parallel universe, he\u2019d be great at preparing sushi \u2013 his knife skills are quite exemplary. Smelling: I mean. The man is either covered in horse manure, stinking mud or other people\u2019s blood, and he wades into rivers fully-clothed. Then dries himself in those same clothes. (Why would you not just take them off? She says. Salivating.) He must absolutely reek, but still: sexy. When his housekeeper pulls off his boots, you can almost see the steam rising out of them \u2013 who cares? HE\u2019S TWO ITEMS CLOSER TO NAKED.  Nightshirts: no man can look good in a nightshirt. Hardy looks excellent \u2013 and I mean excellent \u2013 in a nightshirt. (Sorry, couldn\u2019t find a picture of him in a nightshirt so I put the above naked one up instead.) His nightshirt in Taboo is cut to just the right height \u2013 whoever decided on the length of that nightshirt (what a job to have!) deserves a medal. Hard Boiled Eggs: the only human in the history of all mankind to have ever looked sexy eating a whole hard boiled egg. He just pops the whole thing in and chews. (Episode 2, was it?) Stupid Hats: only Hardy could pull off wearing a hat that looks as though it should belong to a Satanic Lion Tamer. And he actually looks cool \u2013 the big coat, collar up, the big hat, everything in black \u2013 expect something Taboo-inspired when fashion week next comes around\u2026 Ghosts: James Delaney\u2019s dead mother looks like the girl from that horrendous film, The Ring, but thirty years on. That\u2019s what decades of being stuck down a well would do to you. Despite this horrible apparition popping up every time Delaney tries to have sex\/a bath, he remains unflappably hunky. I\u2019m notoriously scaredy-cat when it comes to ghosts and ghouls and so on, but in Taboo I\u2019ve barely flinched \u2013 too busy looking at good old Tom and his distracting tattoos. Tattoos: oh yes, the distracting tattoos. Big black bands that look as though they\u2019ve been drawn on with a giant marker pen, they would look laughable on anyone else, but Hardy (are you beginning to realise the depths of my appreciation for TH?) wears them with aplomb. Here he is naked \u2013 just so you can see the tattoos. Educational.  Digging a grave: why would anyone look hot digging a grave? I don\u2019t know, but Mr Tom manages it. Perhaps it\u2019s because it\u2019s the grave for his sister\u2019s husband, and we know that it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see some sex action now that the husband\u2019s out of the picture. (I realise that it\u2019s wrong on every single level to want to see a man have sex with his sister, but seriously \u2013 watch the series and you\u2019ll understand.) My final \u201cthing that only Tom Hardy can make sexy\u201d was going to be something along that incestuous sort of theme, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how it would come across. \u201cTom Hardy, making incest sexy.\u201d It\u2019s just\u2026wrong, wrong, wrong. If you\u2019d like to dip your toe into the stinking, egg-eating, sister-shagging world of Taboo then the final episode airs tonight at 9.15pm \u2013 you can catch up on the whole series on iPlayer here. Do add your own things to the list in the comments below \u2013 equally, if you can\u2019t stand Tom Hardy or have your own alternative, please feel free to share! *This post replaces the Sunday Tittle Tattle, mainly because I\u2019ve spent so long thinking of the ways in which Tom Hardy is sexy that I\u2019ve run out of time to write it. I\u2019d like to add, also, as a disclaimer, that Mr AMR is miles sexier than Tom Hardy and looks amazing in a nightshirt. (He made me put that.) (He didn\u2019t, but just in case he\u2019s reading.) (Also, he doesn\u2019t smell, kill people or wear stupid hats so I feel I\u2019m onto a winner.)

I don\u2019t know too much about Atkinsons as a brand, other than the fact that they sell their fragrances in big, 100ml hip-flask type bottles that feel slightly as though they should be part of an Alice In Wonderland set\u2026 I know also, from the tatters of my baby-brain memory, that its a brand with quite the heritage \u2013 founded over 200 years ago, and, at one point, the official perfumer to the royals. Despite my lack of background knowledge, I\u2019ve tried quite a few of Atkinsons\u2019 perfumes, including the golden-bottled Oud Save the Queen, but Love In Idleness is the first I\u2019ve adopted into my personal fragrance arsenal. (The one I keep in the house, rather than the stacks of fragrances I have in my office, waiting to be tested!) It made the cut primarily because I love the smell of violets and I rarely come across one that doesn\u2019t smell artificial, like bottled Parma Violets. Love In Idleness is the sort of powdery violet perfume I\u2019ve been hunting down for years. It\u2019s soft, sugary and rather frivolous, but not one of those silly, giggly scents that belong in a twelve-year-old\u2019s body spritz. The mossy, woody base notes prevent it from being too young, but they never really come to the front of the stage, so to speak, so the overall effect of the perfume is that it\u2019s light and fresh, almost sparkling. Browse all fragrance reviews\u2026 The inspiration behind the fragrance is (you may have guessed from the name) Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, and it really does spark little thoughts of fairies\u2019 bowers and magical forests and long, summer nights. I\u2019d love the base notes to come through a little more, if I were to be very picky and incredibly selfish, but I do think that this makes for a wonderful lightweight scent. It has a naughty edge \u2013 or mischievous, I should say \u2013 that stops it from being too sickly sweet. You can find Love In Idleness at Selfridges here \u2013 it\u2019s \u00a3100 for 100ml.

I think, if I remember rightly, that I was pitching it as an alternative to Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Wake Up Balm (review here) \u2013 a glow-giving skin-plumper that, on dull and desperate mornings makes everything seem OK. In the skin department, at least. And do you know what? The Pixi Glowtion is a good alternative \u2013 it\u2019s slightly cheaper, which is always a bit of a boon, and it gives a bright and healthy look to the skin whilst feeling lightweight and fresh to apply. It\u2019s a moisturiser, I suppose, because it moisturises (and does that really well), but it\u2019s also a skin perfector, helping to plump fine lines and create a more radiant, perfected finish. It\u2019s not as \u201cbalmy\u201d in texture as Lauder\u2019s Wake Up Balm, but then it doesn\u2019t pitch itself as a balm, it pitches itself as a \u201cdew\u201d. Don\u2019t be fooled by this \u2013 Glowtion doesn\u2019t feel cool or watery, it\u2019s still quite balm-like, just not as cushiony as the Lauder one and with slightly less of a plumping effect. In terms of actual glow, there\u2019s a little more surface sheen with Pixi\u2019s Glowtion \u2013 it\u2019s almost on a par with Victoria Beckham\u2019s Morning Aura, though not so golden in tone. I\u2019d say it\u2019s part-illuminator part-moisturiser, but it\u2019s not so OTT that it has to be tempered down by a layer of face base \u2013 you can easily wear Glowtion alone and not look like an android. So, in the Lauder vs Pixi race, which one do you go for? Well, I think that Glowtion is lighter and fresher and so great for all skin types, including dehydrated\/oily, which is always a bugger to contend with. But if you prefer a richer, more cushiony feel and have older, more parched skin, then Lauder\u2019s Wake Up Balm is more \u2013 er \u2013 balm-like. It has less sheen, so those with lots of fine lines might prefer the finish, though on the other hand, if you want a proper glow without having to apply makeup then Glowtion is your new best friend. Both products offer superb levels of service when it comes to Crap Skin Rescue, especially if you\u2019re looking for a one-step moisturiser and primer, but Glowtion does it more affordably. You can find Pixi Glowtion at LookFantastic here, \u00a324, or you can bung it in with your ASOS shop here. Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Wake Up Balm is \u00a346 here \u2013 but do read my full review first, because it\u2019s much more than just a surface-perfecting balm.

I actually haven\u0027t attended a Mulberry show since Johnny Coca has been the creative director, so I was really interested to see his designs. As with every show, there are pieces you fall in love with and pieces you could never imagine wearing and I\u0027ve included a few of my favourite looks above (along with pics of my outfit for the show, which was from Mulberry\u0027s Spring collection). The collection felt incredibly royal with the rich colours and oversized jewels, which worked together beautifully. I love that Johnny also kept a real British feel to the clothes with the tweed fabrics and clear influences of the English countryside. I don\u0027t have any pictures to show you guys, but some of the bags were just amazing, you can see a glimpse of a yellow bag in the photo above which I have become a bit obsessed with!

I love that Domenico and Stefano really embrace social media and are so forward thinking - this season they had quite a few influencers walking in their show alongside traditional models, streamed the show live on their website (which my whole family were glued too!) and also shared a ton of photos on their Instagram of the build up for show and the runway looks. I think it\u0027s really important to move with the times and find a way to involve people at home who can\u0027t attend the show, so a big thumbs up from me! I\u0027m not going to talk about the fashion in depth as men\u0027s fashion is much more Jim\u0027s thing than mine, but the show was completely beautiful and glamorous and I loved it. I was very lucky to be dressed head to toe in Dolce \u0026 Gabanna (apart from my sunnies which are by Le Specs), which was so special. I was really happy with the looks I wore to the show and the afterparty. Annoyingly I only have one photo of me in my evening dress, but you can find it on my Instagram! I want to say a massive thank you to Mauritzio in the London store for allowing me to have total creative freedom with my looks and style myself. He made the experience even more amazing! I thought I would pop on here some close ups of my outfit I wore to the show as the pieces were so beautiful and you couldn\u0027t see them in great detail on my Instagram pictures. Also, I\u0027ve added some photos of the boys - I love the backstage one of them in their gowns and flip flops so much! I hope you\u0027re all having a beautiful day.

So, being the organised person that I am (I\u0027m not really, I just happened to be this morning), I started planning my makeup look on the way home from the gym. That way I knew I could jump in the shower, shove on a jumper, jeans and heeled boots (heeled boots are the key to looking put together when you\u0027re running late), do my makeup in 5 minutes and still have time to feed the dog before making my way into Central London. I also managed to have time to take a couple of blog photos in this time too, literally the fastest blog post I\u0027ve ever shot! I thought perhaps you guys might find this post useful if you often have to look presentable in a hurry. This is my go to look. Clinque Beyond Perfecting Foundation I discovered this foundation when I was working with Clinique in December and it is just brilliant. Amazing coverage, but feels smooth and light on the skin. Today I mixed Alabaster and Creamwhip as I\u0027m in between those two shades at the moment. It\u0027s also perfect when I\u0027m in a hurry as it acts as a concealer too. Kevyn Aucoin Medium Contour Powder  This has been my top contour powder for over a year now. Even when I\u0027m in a hurry contouring is really important to me as it gives my face so much definition and makes me feel good. Tanya Burr Cosmetics Perfect Brows You guys know ever since I designed this product I hardly ever use anything else on my brows. It\u0027s just the perfect colour, really quick and easy to apply and lasts all day. Maybelline Lash Sensational Mascara This mascara gives me full lashes with minimal effort, so great for when I don\u0027t have much time! MAC Extended Play Mascara I always use this mascara on my lower lashes no matter what mascara I\u0027m using on top as I find the thin brush easy to use on my bottom lashes and also it stays put, whereas all the mascaras I like to use on my top lashes end up printing underneath my eyes throughout the day if I use them on the bottom. Tanya Burr Cosmetics Pink Cocoa Lip Stick This is just my perfect every day lipstick shade.

Specifically how I\u0027ve been styling mine. Questions have been rolling in over social media recently wanting to know how I\u0027ve been achieving my go to style - easy laid back waves, so today I\u0027m going to give you a step by step guide to literally the simplest hair look ever! I\u0027ve also teamed up with TRESemm\u00e9 for this post as, drumroll please.. I\u0027ll be flying out to New York with them on Friday for Fashion Week! Without doubt TRESemm\u00e9 are a hair staple these days, and I\u0027ve used three of their best styling products in todays look. Perfect hair isn\u0027t always easy, and this season TRESemm\u00e9 want to inspire and empower you to #WorkIt with their huge range of products to get the look you love, whether that\u0027s laid back and lived in, or glammed up super chic! I\u0027ll also be going backstage with them for a handful of shows, so expect to see a lot of NYFW content coming your way soon! - This is a sponsored post in collaboration with TRESemm\u00e9 -  Step One: Boost This style honestly couldn\u0027t be easier to fit into your routine, as it literally takes me ten minutes to wiz through every morning. Prep is key to a quick style though, so I usually start things off the night before when I wash my hair. Volume is the number one for me when it comes to my hair aspirations, and mousse is one of the best products to use for this. Starting with damp hair I comb through about a golf ball sized amount of the TRESemm\u00e9 Volume \u0026 Lift Mousse with my fingers, concentrating it at the roots. A quick blast of the hair dryer leaves my hair with long-lasting fullness without the sticky texture of a dry spray, as well as all the weightless volume I could ever need! Don\u0027t forget to run whats left in your hands into the rest of your hair too, as this is going to hold in the waves when we come to using heat.    Step Two: Protect Before you step anywhere near the curling wand though, protecting your hair is key. The TRESemm\u00e9 Heat Defense Styling Spray has been around ever since I picked up my first pair of GHD\u0027s a long, long time ago. It keeps hair safe up to 230 degrees and increases softness and shine too. I honestly think I\u0027ve stuck with this spray for so long because the nozzle is just the best (weirdo alert, I know). A lot of spray products can end up leaving a whole lot of product in one little spot on your head - not great when I\u0027m trying my best to protect every single overprocessed, overworked strand! Whereas the spritz on this is such a fine mist it covers lightly and evenly all over.  SHOP THE POST      Step Three: Texture Next, onto the main part of this routine - adding the waves. My tool of choice is a medium tapered curling wand, but you can also get a similar effect with straighteners if you have those to hand. The most important part of achieving lose falling curls is actually how you hold the wand. With much trial and error I\u0027ve found pointing it down and at a forty-five degree angle (or thereabouts) gives the best curl formation. Also the way in which you wrap the hair makes a huge difference too. If you twist as you go, things are going to end up on the 80\u0027s side of kinky, so make sure you keep the hair flat and straight against the wand. Try not to overthink it though - with practice you\u0027ll have the technique down in your sleep.   EXTRA TIP! While the hair is cooling, pull apart the curls with your fingers. This breaks up the texture into waves and gives a much more seperated effect than brushing out with a comb, and doesn\u0027t leave them as broken down as running your hands all the way through.    Step Four: Hold Depending on your hair texture this style might last all day, but for my naturally straight and flat hair I like the guaranteed hold of a setting product. The Extra Hold Hairspray from TRESEmm\u00e9 is seriously heavy duty in keeping loose waves in place, but without any of the stiffness you\u0027d usually think came hand in hand with a maximum hold spray. My hair still feels soft enough to run my fingers through after this step and I also like to spray some through the roots for a last boost of volume, as well as keeping flyaways at bay. It\u0027s humidity resistant as well - perfect for the frizz prone, humid streets of NYC!

Reactivate it to view this content. Kicking off the festivities around these parts, I\u0027ve compiled a little Christmas Wishlist of mine to share with you today! I\u0027m not massively into gift guides (although I have one up on my channel if you\u0027re looking for a special beauty gift to give this year!) but I thought taking a peek at my own personal list would be fun! Sidenote\/disclaimer, wishful thinking is playing a very big part here..  All I Want For Christmas Is..  Missoma Mini Fang Necklace - This super dainty little piece has been playing on my mind for months now! I\u0027ve been way more into silver metals recently but the combination of the warm gold and the sweet little \u0027fang\u0027 charms on this necklace is gorgeous. It also comes in a longer version too! Bella Freud Signature Candle - Would it be an ICT Wishlist if it didn\u0027t involve a candle? All of the Bella Freud candles sound totally unique and the packaging is 10\/10. This one is Incense Wood \u0026 Oud - warm, spicy and everything I love at this time of year! Oliver Bonas Print - When we moved into a place with more space over a year ago now, I envisioned walls covered in prints, but its something I\u0027ve yet to put much thought into. Oliver Bonas - always my go-to for gift giving, have the best little selection of pre-framed prints (already making life so much easier) and this Andy Warhol quote speaks to me on many levels. Oliver Bonas Table Lamp - Who doesn\u0027t love a lamp? Particularly when it comes in polka dot form. I love these concrete base lights and I\u0027ve been looking for the right one to sit on my dressing table for some time now.. Saint Laurent Pink Blogger Bag - This is where things fall slightly into the absurd. I love my little black version of this bag and think the pink one would be adorable for Spring and Summer! Oliver Bonas Cocktail Set - My Christmas present to myself this year (ahem, thats totally a thing, right?) is this incredible gold and marble bar table that I\u0027ve been pining over forever. I\u0027m not a huge drinker, but what\u0027s better than mixing up a cosy cocktail on a Winter\u0027s evening and this Jigger \u0026 Spoon set from Oliver Bonas would be the perfect addition! Also not quite over the fact that \u0027Jigger\u0027 is actually the word for that measuring cup.. I\u0027ll show myself out. Chanel Le Crayon L\u00e8vres in 34 Natural - Believe it or not this little lip pencil has been a tricky one to find. I think I\u0027ve got lipsticks pretty much down for now. Please, no more! But it\u0027s lip liners that I really don\u0027t have enough of. This pinkish browny nude would be the perfect shade to wear alone or with just about any lip colour. Bella Freud Embroidered Jumper - Wishful thinking strikes again with this Bella Freud jumper. I know I\u0027d wear this to death though as it checks all the boxes for me; grey, embroidered, a little bit out there.. perfect! Missoma Moon Stud - Another cheeky Missoma edition - I love this brand! Of course anything to do with Moons gets my instant attention these days. I\u0027m really into mixing \u0026 matching my earrings at the moment and love that you can buy these individually to do so. There\u0027s so many beautiful studs and styles but this one has to be my favourite!   A FEW LITTLE EXTRAS As if that wasn\u0027t enough, I also have a few other bits on my Wishlist that I\u0027ve listed below. I\u0027m constantly adding to this list whenever I find something that would make a perfect gift, for myself or others. So keep checking back if you\u0027re after some Christmas inspiration!

Ik vind Hoola fijn en mooi, maar helaas ook n\u00e8t wat te donker voor mijn porseleinen huidskleur. Ik was dan ook erg blij toen ik hoorde van Hoola Lite, een nieuwe, lichtere bronzer. Ik heb hem getest en vergeleken met de originele Hoola.    Hoola Lite is nog maar net te koop, maar ik kreeg er al best veel vragen over van jullie. Ik was zelf ook heel benieuwd naar de bronzer, die ontzettend lijkt op de originele Hoola, maar de lichtere variant ervan is. Mocht je na het lezen van deze review gelijk naar de winkel willen rennen; dat kan, want Hoola Lite is al te koop. Benefit Hoola Lite \u20ac 34,00   Hoola Lite is lekker licht, dat zag ik meteen. Maar in vergelijking met de originele Hoola is het nog eens extra goed zichtbaar. Allebei de bronzers hebben een zachte en matte textuur, die makkelijk aanbrengt en inblendt met de huid.  Hoola \u2013 Hoola Lite Met het swatchen schrok ik wel een beetje. Is Hoola Lite niet veel te oranje? Hoola lijkt een stuk bruiner, Hoola Lite lijkt meer geel.  Geen bronzer Hoola aangebracht Hoola Lite aangebracht  Hoola \u2013 Hoola Lite  Hoola Lite eenmaal aangebracht, zie ik dat de bronzer gelukkig helemaal niet te oranje is. Ja, het is een bronzer met warme ondertoon, maar het is ook duidelijk een lichtere variant van de originele Hoola. Hoola Lite oogt zacht en natuurlijk op mijn lichte huid.  Make-uplook afgemaakt met Hoola Lite  Ik was best wel verrast toen ik voor het eerst over Hoola Lite hoorde. Een lichtere Hoola, dat had ik op de een of andere manier gewoon niet verwacht. Maar nu ik hem getest heb, snap ik het beter en, denk ik dat Benefit een goede keuze gemaakt heeft. Hoola Lite is heel mooi natuurlijk en warm. De poeder brengt makkelijk aan, blendt mooi in en het resultaat oogt op mijn huid een stuk natuurlijker dan met de originele Hoola. Dit is een blijvertje! Hoola Lite is nu te koop bij Douglas winkels en hier* online.","date":"1488344400","title":"Benefit Hoola Lite (vs de originele Hoola)","media":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/benefit_hoola_lite01.jpg","num_loves":"4","num_saves":"2","num_comments":"0","post_tags":["high end","bronzer","hoola","lite","mat","review","vergelijking"],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"575x383","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/benefit_hoola_lite01.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnZlcmFjYW1pbGxhLm5sJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkZiZW5lZml0X2hvb2xhX2xpdGUwMS5qcGc=?checksum=a7c801cbf99a7ace5f9d890575e438dcfed8d197\u0026format=h"}},"name":"veracamilla.nl","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=5482036181\u0026blog=1129512\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=blog_profile","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/1129512\/5482036181","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/veracamillanl-1129512\/benefit-hoola-lite-vs-de-originele-hoola-5482036181","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/veracamillanl-1129512\/benefit-hoola-lite-vs-de-originele-hoola-5482036181","likes":6},"5479820441:1129512":{"post_id":"5479820441","blog_id":"1129512","link":"http:\/\/veracamilla.nl\/2017\/02\/catrice-rock-couture-extreme-volume-mascara-24h\/","content":"De Catrice Rock Couture Extreme Volume Mascara gebruik ik nou al een tijdje, maar vond ik toch wel een review waard. De mascara zit in een geweldige tube met \u2018studded\u2019 dop, is heel betaalbaar en ik heb er een beetje een haat\/liefde verhouding mee. Ik zal je vertellen waarom.    Je hebt me de mascara al een aantal keer kunnen zien gebruiken, bijvoorbeeld in de high end vs low-budget dupes make-up video. Ik kreeg de mascara een aantal weken geleden opgestuurd, omdat hij nieuw is in het assortiment van Catrice. De Rock Couture Extreme Volume Mascara belooft veel volume \u00e9n mooie gekrulde wimpers. Ik heb de gewone variant, maar er is ook een waterproof mascara verkrijgbaar. Catrice Rock Couture Extreme Volume Mascara 24H \u20ac 3,99  De mascaraborstel is vrij stevig en heeft korte, rubberen haartjes. Rondom de mascara, maar ook op de bovenkant. Zo kun je elk wimperhaartje zwart kleuren.   Ik vind het effect heel mooi. Vol, volumineus en mijn wimpers zijn ook wat meer gekruld waardoor ze nog langer lijken. De mascara is vrij dik, zonder dat hij klontert. Althans, als je de borstel goed uit de tube haalt. Zoals ik in de inleiding al vertelde heb ik een haat\/liefde verhouding met de mascara, omdat wanneer de borstel net iets te schuin uit de tube komt, de stopper niet goed werkt waardoor er teveel mascara op de borstel komt en hij gaat klonteren.  Het is dus belangrijk dat je de borstel helemaal recht uit de tube haalt, om ervoor te zorgen dat er niet teveel mascara op de borstel zit. Dat is niet moeilijk, maar wel belangrijk om te weten. Doe je dat goed, dan is de Catrice Rock Couture Extreme Volume Mascara een hele fijne. Ik gebruik hem dus al een tijdje en gebruik hem voorlopig ook nog wel gebruiken. Hij doet precies wat ik momenteel het belangrijkst vind. Hij zet mijn wimpers mooi aan, ze vallen op, lijken voller en langer.

De lente komt steeds dichterbij en van de week hoorde ik zelfs al twee keer buiten vogeltjes fluiten. Afgelopen week kreeg ik de smaak met het sporten eindelijk te pakken. Ik vond mijn ritme en ben lekker vaak gegaan. Daar ben ik zo ontzettend blij om! Ook ontving ik weer mooie producten om te reviewen en kocht ik een geweldige nieuwe tas\u2026   De chaos na het filmen van een nieuwe eerste indruk video met Benefit They\u2019re Real! Duo Shadow Blender en Double The Lip.  Ik Facetimede \u2019s middags met Alexander en Angela (sorry jongens voor de lelijke screenshot) om samen de foto\u2019s van de fotoshoot van een paar weken geleden door te nemen. Ze zijn ontzettend cool geworden, ben er heel blij mee en kan niet wachten tot jullie het ook kunnen zien! Nog even geduld\u2026  De bestelde Mooncup kwam eindelijk binnen! Ik ga deze menstruatiecup testen en er een video over maken.  Aan het einde van de middag at ik nog snel even wat druiven en pakte toen mijn sportkleding bij elkaar om naar de sportschool te gaan.  Na het sporten lekker met gewassen haar en een maskertje op in bed, The Big Bang Theory afleveringen kijken.  Zaterdag gingen Jeffrey en ik de stad in. Ik kocht bij de nieuwe Saint Laurent counter in de Bijenkorf een prachtige Kate tas, waar ik waanzinnig blij mee ben.  En \u2019s avonds aten we samen weer eens bij Happyhappyjoyjoy.  Zondag moest het huis grondig geschrobd, gesopt en schoongeboend worden. De badkamer vind ik altijd zo stom om te doen, maar geeft me wel het meeste voldoening. Blinkend schone wasbakken, ahh\u2026  Oeps. Ik maakte tijdens het opruimen een van mijn kandelaars stuk. Ik had eigenlijk geen idee dat ze van glas gemaakt waren. Gelukkig wilde ik ze al opbergen omdat ik ze niet meer zo mooi vind, dus heel erg vind ik het niet.  Eindelijk de lips led lamp ophangen!  ZO gaaf! Ben er mega blij mee.  De letterbox kreeg een plekje op het gangkastje.  Ik moest zo lachen om Jeffrey met mijn slaapmaker op, dat deze foto daarom bewogen is.  Zo koud!  Maandagmiddag ging ik naar de sportschool. De leuke \u2018I don\u2019t sweat, I sparkle\u2019 bidon is van H\u0026M, maar lekt helaas wel.  Na het sporten maakte Jeff pangasiusfilet met courgette en spinazie en zoete aardappeltjes uit de oven. Die verbrandden helaas een beetje, maar verder was dit een heel lekker gerecht.  Dinsdag in de auto met m\u2019n mooie nieuwe tas.  Koffie drinken bij Metropolitain met Tess.  Ik wilde al zo lang eens met Tess afspreken en was zo blij dat het nu eindelijk lukte. Het was heel erg gezellig en ik vond het heel leuk om alles over haar plannen met Details of Beauty te horen.  Dinsdagavond ging ik weer sporten en ontdekte tijdens het sporten dat ik m\u2019n shirt binnenstebuiten had. Story of my life.  Na het sporten lekkere tartaarburgers eten.  \u2764\ufe0f mijn nieuwe trui! Hij is van Forever 21.  Wauwww, super mooie producten voor de lente van Givenchy.  En nieuw parfum! Very Irresistible (met glitter) kreeg ik voor de feestdagen en vond ik al heel lekker, maar Live Irresistible ruikt ook goed.  Op aanraden van Tess bestelde ik dit super mooie compact spiegeltje van Chanel.  Ik krijg steeds vaker vragen over mijn wimpers. Of ik misschien kunstwimpers draag, of hoe ze zo lang zijn geworden. Ik ben al een aantal weken een nieuw product van Kruidvat aan het testen, waardoor mijn wimpers een stuk langer en gezonder aan het worden zijn. Super leuk en mooi om te zien. Dit product is nog niet te koop, ik ben de eerste die het mag proberen! Hou mijn blog in de gaten voor de uitgebreide review met alle informatie. (spon)  Ook woensdagavond ging ik sporten. Dit shirt van Forever 21 met gaatjes vind ik super fijn omdat hij lekker luchtig is. Sowieso ben ik heel blij dat ik eindelijk goede sportkleding heb. Fijne shirts, sportbeha\u2019s en broeken. Maakt het bewegen een stuk comfortabeler.  Donderdagmiddag maakte Jeffrey deze reusachtige sushi bowl. Die kreeg ik nog niet eens voor de helft op.  De stempas is binnen! Ik ga zeker stemmen op 15 maart.  Donderdagavond ging ik voor de laatste keer deze week naar de sportschool.  Hopelijk zijn jullie mij met alle sportschoolfoto\u2019s nog niet zat, daarom om het goed te maken deze charmante foto van mij met een tomatenhoofd. Hoe was jouw week?

deze week werd volgende week. Maar hier de beloofde blogpost. Het is alweer even geleden dat ik jullie vertelde over mijn coachingsessies bij GORTcoaching. Zij boden mij een kennismakingsgesprek aan, plus drie sessies met een coach naar keuze. Ik vond een hele leuke coach in Amsterdam (maar je kan eigenlijk in heel veel plekken in Nederland terecht) en het inmiddels heb ik de sessies achter de rug. Ze vonden plaats rondom mijn shows in TivoliVredenburg en dat was wel heel fijn, want op die manier had ik steun aan de goede gesprekken die ik met mijn coach voerde. Ik kwam bij haar met een aantal thema\u2019s: de balans tussen werk en priv\u00e9, het altijd \u2018aan\u2019 staan en mijn uitstelgedrag. Drie sessies is natuurlijk kort en ik moet eerlijk zeggen dat vooral het \u2018aan\u2019 staan de boventoon was in de weken dat ik bij haar kwam, dus dat is ook eigenlijk waar we aan hebben gewerkt. Waar we samen al snel op stuitten is dat er een soort tegenstrijdigheid in mij schuilt. Aan de ene kant wil en durf ik veel, heb ik grootse dromen en ambities. Aan de andere kant is er dat stemmetje dat me naar beneden praat, ervoor zorgt dat ik zorgen om alles heb en wil dat mijn zenuwen de overhand krijgen. Naar aanleiding daarvan liet ze me als eerste oefening een bus tekenen. Een bus? Ja, een bus. Vervolgens vroeg ze me de bus te zien als mij als mens (of mijn hersenen, hoe je het wil bekijken) en de passagiers op die bus erin te tekenen. Een abstracte opdracht, maar gek genoeg wist ik gelijk wat ik moest maken. Aan het stuur kwam een leeuw (passie\/vuur), achterin de bus een muis (angst\/onzekerheid). Daar tussenin een meisje dat heel boos kijkt (de stem die mij nooit goed genoeg vindt en boos wordt als ik wat fout doe) en een meisje dat eerder zielig en vermoeid kijkt (de stem die me vertelt dat het teveel is). Tot slot heb ik bovenop de bus nog een vlinder getekend en die staat voor de stem die het altijd iedereen naar zijn of haar zin wil maken. Het stemmetje dat bij elke keuze die ik maak zich afvraagt wat een ander ervan zou vinden. Het was zo bijzonder om na het tekenen die bus op papier te zien. Het ging super snel, ik had op een of andere manier gelijk door wat er allemaal in de bus moest zitten en het was daardoor ook heel duidelijk voor mezelf. Ik wist wel dat het druk was in mijn hoofd, maar ik had er nog nooit zo\u2019n beeld bij gehad.  We deden niet alleen maar oefeningen tijdens de sessies zelf. Mijn coach stuurde me ook wel eens oefeningen na om thuis te doen, afgesteld op waar we over hadden gepraat of wat ik precies nodig had in die situatie. Een daarvan was bijvoorbeeld de ankeroefening, waarbij je een handeling koppelt aan een prettige stemming. Ook deed ik een test om erachter te komen of ik HSP ben (jup) en een ander die ging over mijn omgang met mijn agenda en de gerichtheid op urgentie. Van beide testen wist ik van tevoren stiekem het antwoord al, maar het was toch fijn om een soort bevestiging te hebben op wat ik zelf al verwachtte.  Deze oefening laat ik jullie graag zien, omdat ik met deze nog het meest bezig ben de laatste tijd. In eerste instantie zag deze cirkel er heel anders uit toen ik hem tekende. Mijn coach vroeg me namelijk een cirkel op te delen in alles wat een rol speelt in mijn leven. De eerste keer dat ik dat deed tijdens de sessie bestond bijna driekwart uit carri\u00e8re en de rest uit familie\/vrienden\/thuis\/hobby. De eerste vraag die me toen stelde was: \u2018En waar ben jij zelf?\u2019. Daar moest ik even over nadenken. Ik had er helemaal niet over nagedacht dat ik zelf ook nog een plekje in de cirkel moest krijgen en dat gaf eigenlijk al genoeg aan. In de sessie die daarop volgde moest ik een versie van de cirkel meenemen die mijn ideale situatie aangaf. Dat is de cirkel die je hierboven ziet. Een kwart voor familie\/vrienden\/thuis, een kwart voor mijn carri\u00e8re en een helft voor mijzelf. En die vijftig procent voor mijzelf bestaat dan uit gezondheid, ontspanning en zelfontwikkeling. Ook staan er wat aantekeningen bij. Een paar zijn vanzelfsprekend, maar twee wil ik even toelichten. Bewuste uit-momenten (maar hoe?) Dit is nog een vraagstuk. Ik heb veel gepraat over het gevoel van constant \u2018aan\u2019 staan, alsof mijn brein nooit eventjes pauze neemt. Vandaar dat ik meer bewuste uit-momenten wil plannen. Dat zie je hieronder ook in een voorbeeld van mijn agenda. Momenten waarop ik niet bezig ben met werk, wat anderen nodig hebben, wat ik allemaal op social media wil plaatsen, wat ik morgen moet doen en wat ik gisteren ben vergeten. Heel eerlijk: het lukt me nog niet zo goed. Maar ik ben wel steeds vaker niet aan het werk \u2019s avonds. Soms nog wel, maar het is een begin 1\/2x per week familie\/vrienden want: zuigt energie Deze wil ik ook even toelichten, want zo klinkt het net alsof ik nooit energie krijg van ontmoetingen met familie of vrienden. Dat is niet zo, maar feit is wel dat ik gevoelig ben voor stemmingen en vaak de stemming van anderen overneem. Daardoor kosten sociale events me vaak veel energie. Ik vind het ontz\u00e9ttend leuk om af te spreken, maar zo nu en dan sla ik eventjes door. Dan heb ik bijvoorbeeld in een week drie etentjes \u00e9n ga ik een hele dag naar iemand toe om te filmen en chillen. Vervolgens zit ik het hele weekend bij familie. Vandaar de beslissing: 1\/2 keer per week sociale events. En dat gaat best goed.  Zoals je kan zien heb ik in drie sessies toch meer geleerd en gedaan dan je zou verwachten. Ik had nog langer door kunnen gaan met mijn coach, maar ik heb ervoor gekozen om dat op dit punt niet te doen. Heel eerlijk gezegd merkte ik rond Tivoli dat er nog wat dingen in mijn brein dieper zaten dan ik dacht en kwam ik tot de conclusie dat ik beter eerst weer naar therapie kon, omdat coaching nou eenmaal een stuk praktischer is. Nu ik dit schrijf midden december weet ik eventjes niet wat ik wil. Het gaat op dit moment goed met me, maar als ik kijk naar hoe vlak en somber ik me voelde voor en vooral n\u00e1 Tivoli denk ik wel dat het goed is om nog te zoeken naar een psychotherapeut die me meer inzicht kan bieden in waar dat vandaan komt. ^ zoals je hierboven kan lezen heb ik dit dus midden december geschreven. Inmiddels zijn we 1,5 maand verder en het gaat erg goed met me op het moment. Ik leer met de dag en ik zou niet zeggen dat ik geen sombere neigingen meer heb, maar ik weet wel een stuk beter hoe ik met mezelf om moet gaan op dat soort momenten: minder druk op mezelf leggen. Het blijft natuurlijk een leerproces :)  In ieder geval hebben deze sessies door GORTcoaching me echt goed gedaan en heb ik dingen geleerd waar ik nog steeds mee bezig ben. Daar ben ik dus super dankbaar voor! Het is zeker een van de meest bijzondere samenwerkingen die ik ooit heb gehad. Mocht je benieuwd zijn geworden: je kan een gratis ori\u00ebntatiegesprek inplannen bij GORTcoaching en als je dan na het gesprek start met coaching en mailt naar fan@gortcoaching.nl dat je via mij bent gekomen, dan hebben ze een cadeautje voor je.

Maar omdat ik al eventjes weg ben geweest van mijn blog, leek het me gek om dat zo out of the blue te publiceren. Het is best een gevoelig stuk, maar bij het schrijven van dat soort stukken kom ik er altijd wel achter hoe blij ik ben dat ik nog ergens een platform heb om zulke artikelen op te zetten. Andere sociale media zijn daar toch minder geschikt voor en dat er inmiddels nog maar een relatief klein groepje overgebleven op mijn blog geeft me een veilig gevoel. Cijfers. Ik heb echt veel nagedacht over cijfers de laatste tijd. Begin januari kreeg ik in het ziekenhuis te horen dat ik PCOS heb. Gek genoeg ging ik er met precies dat voorgevoel naartoe. Mijn cyclus was zo extreem onregelmatig (lees: ik was al een jaar niet ongesteld geworden) dat ik het graag wilde nakijken, maar op de een of andere manier verwachtte ik al dat dit het zou zijn. Een hormoonstoornis, waarvan de meest impactvolle eigenschap is dat je een verminderde of geen eisprong hebt. Wat dan meteen ook weer betekent dat het niet makkelijk is om kinderen te krijgen. Bij het horen van slecht nieuws komt er in eerste instantie vaak iets sto\u00efcijns over me heen en wil ik alles kapot relativeren, maar na eventjes breek ik toch en dus ben ik hierover ook heel verdrietig geweest. Er is van alles mogelijk in de medische wereld, maar ik vind het menselijk lichaam z\u00f3 mooi en fascinerend en ik had zo graag gewild dat het op een natuurlijke manier zou werken bij mij. Het voelde echt eventjes alsof ik niet compleet was als vrouw zijnde, maar dat gevoel heb ik gelukkig ook weer snel van me af kunnen zetten. Hopelijk kan ik alsnog op de natuurlijke manier kinderen krijgen later, want ik heb namelijk besloten om volledig suikervrij te gaan eten (m.u.v. fruitsuikers en eventuele suikervervangers met een lage G.I.). Dat zou de situatie namelijk kunnen verbeteren en er zijn veel succesverhalen over te vinden. Ook kan suikervrij eten bij PCOS helpen voor vermindering van angsten en depressieve neigingen. Ten opzichte van vrouwen die geen PCOS hebben komen depressies 4 keer zo vaak voor en angstklachten komen 6 keer zo vaak voor. Aangezien ik met die twee aspecten afgelopen jaar (lichtjes) kennis heb gemaakt, ben ik ook heel erg benieuwd naar een eventuele verandering daarin. Toen ik dat inzicht kreeg en me een voorstelling maakte van een leven zonder suiker ging mijn eerste gedachte naar mijn werk. Naar mijn serie Proefwerk, om precies te zijn. Nog nooit had ik een serie die zo succesvol was. Vrijwel elke aflevering is over de 100.000 views gegaan, wat voor mij echt een heleboel is. Vandaar dat Proefwerk ook binnen mijn werk hetgeen was dat het meeste geld opleverde. Aan de ene kant is het dus erg logisch dat ik daar gelijk aan moest denken, maar aan de andere kant haatte ik mezelf eventjes. Het was gezondheid versus werk. Toekomstdroom versus geld. Al eerder maakte ik een carri\u00e8remove die me niet per se financieel hielp, namelijk het stoppen met gebruiken van cosmetica die op dieren getest wordt. Ik verloor een paar van mijn belangrijkste adverteerders, maar ik werd er zelf wel een stuk gelukkiger van op gebied van principes en hoe ik kijk naar de wereld. Vandaar dat ik ook snel besloot dat de cijfers me in deze zin niet in de weg mochten staan. Toch bleef het knagen en opeens werd ik geconfronteerd met het meest onzekere van wat ik doe: alles is afhankelijk van mijn publiek. En natuurlijk heb ik een vaste kern die ontzettend trouw is en me waarschijnlijk nog zal supporten wanneer ik in elke video een broodje met kaas eet zonder iets te zeggen, maar met alleen die mensen ga ik het helaas niet redden als ik dit wil blijven doen als fulltime werk. Ik ben niet een extreme optimist, maar ik ben gelukkig ook geen pessimist. Ik ging daarom ook weer direct op zoek naar manieren waarop ik alsnog een grote groep mensen kan aanspreken, maar wel dingen kan doen die passen bij mij en vooral passen in het leven dat ik nu leid. Een leven waarin ook muziek een steeds grotere rol aanneemt, een leven waarin ik er steeds meer achter kom dat ik niet naar mezelf wil kijken en ontevreden wil zijn met wat ik daar zie. Er kwamen twee series in me op waar ik me nu heel veilig bij voel en waarvan ik denk dat het zowel kan werken voor die vaste kern, als iemand die toevallig voorbij surft op YouTube. Ik hoop het maar. Ik denk het wel. Als ik er blij van word, zijn er ongetwijfeld mensen die dat ook hebben. Interessant wel, hoor. Cijfers.

Ik weet niet of ik het per definitie erg vind, maar ik vind het wel bizar dat het net is alsof ik met mijn ogen heb geknipperd en er een half jaar voorbij is gegaan. Zes maanden geleden kwam mijn single met Polska uit en de maanden die erna kwamen voelen eigenlijk nog het meeste als een droom waar ik nog steeds niet uit ben ontwaakt. Er gebeurt zo veel leuks, en tegelijkertijd pesten mijn hersenen me en vertellen ze me dat er genoeg is om me zorgen over te maken.  Ik kwam op de gedachte dat de tijd snel ging, omdat ik twee foto\u2019s tegen kwam die ik al veel eerder met jullie had willen delen, maar dat nog niet had gedaan. Niet dat ze mega bijzonder zijn, maar ik vond het gewoon mooie plaatjes. Een rechtermuisklik op de foto\u2019s vertelde me dat ze uit juli kwamen, en juli lijkt zo ver weg als ik op een dag als deze naar buiten kijk en voornamelijk grijze lucht zie. De herfst is echt begonnen en dat merk ik aan alles. Bij gebrek aan daglicht heb ik dus het huis maar alvast vol gehangen met lampjes. Het is nog vroeg, maar de Kerstboom staat al en de grote hoeveelheid kaarsjes en lichtjes ook. Ik had er zoveel behoefte aan en nu ik het allemaal heb versierd is het een stuk gezelliger in huis. Ik zou willen dat het sociaal geaccepteerd was om de Kerstboom het hele jaar te laten staan. Misschien moet ik er maar wat anders op verzinnen, zoals een lichtsnoer ophangen die niet zo zeer iets met de feestdagen te maken heeft, zodat hij ook op zwoele zomeravonden nog voor sfeer kan zorgen. Lampjes maken me gewoon gelukkig, wanneer het buiten donker is. Maar de tijd gaat snel. Echt snel. Maakten Omar en ik vorig jaar nog de keuze om een show in Tivoli te doen, kondigde ik vorige week een show in Paradiso aan. En Noorderslag. En Concert At Sea. Het lijkt als gisteren dat Alwin, Saske en ik besloten om een docuserie te gaan maken over mijn avonturen en volgende maand uploaden we daarvan alweer de laatste aflevering. Ik kan me mijn eerste zoen met Mert nog zo goed herinneren en volgende week zijn we vijf jaar samen. Opeens is mijn grootste zus 30 jaar geworden, opeens is het twee jaar geleden dat mijn eerste single uit kwam, opeens is Omar papa, opeens is mijn pony alweer uitgegroeid en onmogelijk om naar voren te dragen, opeens zijn Saske en Alwin alweer een jaar verloofd, opeens is het zeven jaar geleden dat ik gillend vooraan stond bij het Jonas Brothers concert en opeens ben ik alweer drie jaar full time aan het werk.  Maar misschien is het ook wel lekker dat de tijd zo snel gaat. Ik kan me zo\u2019n zorgen maken en voor ik het weet is dat moment dan weer voorbij. Aan de andere kant wil ik de komende maanden echt meer proberen om in het moment te leven. Mijn gedachten bestaan voornamelijk uit verleden en toekomst, terwijl er nu op dit moment ook prachtige dingen gebeuren. De focus op wat ik heb, niet op wat nog gaat komen of al is gebeurd. (voor het geval dat je er overheen hebt gelezen, ik geef dus een show in Paradiso volgend jaar op 7 april en het lijkt me fantastisch als je komt. hier kan je tickets kopen) Het bericht \u2022 de tijd gaat zo snel \u2022 verscheen eerst op Teske.nl | Teske de Schepper.","date":"1479913280","title":"\u2022 de tijd gaat zo snel \u2022","media":"http:\/\/www.teske.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/IMG_6248.jpg","num_loves":7,"num_saves":1,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":["personal","fotografie","persoonlijk","tijd"],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"750x688","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/www.teske.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/IMG_6248.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy50ZXNrZS5ubCUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjExJTJGSU1HXzYyNDguanBn?checksum=5be6bf7854507c2a083e59656108d4d6e37a975a\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Teskuh.nl","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=5285071119\u0026blog=1563293\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=blog_profile","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/1563293\/5285071119","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/teskuhnl-1563293\/-de-tijd-gaat-zo-snel-5285071119","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/teskuhnl-1563293\/-de-tijd-gaat-zo-snel-5285071119","likes":8},"5260807047:1563293":{"post_id":"5260807047","blog_id":"1563293","link":"http:\/\/www.teske.nl\/2016\/11\/12\/dakraam\/","content":"\u2666 had ik maar een dakraam voor de slapeloze nachten en de wirwar aan gedachten die ik niet kon weerstaan kreeg ik maar een raam erbij dan sloot ik nu een pact had ik tenminste nog contact met de sterren boven mij \u2666 Het bericht \u2022 dakraam \u2022 verscheen eerst op Teske.nl | Teske de Schepper.","date":"1478905967","title":"\u2022 dakraam \u2022","media":"http:\/\/www.teske.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/IMG_3664b.jpg","num_loves":9,"num_saves":2,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":["personal","gedicht","persoonlijk"],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"750x573","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/www.teske.nl\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/IMG_3664b.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy50ZXNrZS5ubCUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjExJTJGSU1HXzM2NjRiLmpwZw==?checksum=32cee649ac9574a8325c779d4445dc696ab91e8c\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Teskuh.nl","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=5260807047\u0026blog=1563293\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=blog_profile","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/1563293\/5260807047","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/teskuhnl-1563293\/-dakraam-5260807047","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/teskuhnl-1563293\/-dakraam-5260807047","likes":11},"5480891991:18272233":{"post_id":"5480891991","blog_id":"18272233","link":"https:\/\/www.fleurdeforce.com\/2017\/02\/wardrobe-black-everything.html","content":"Today I wanted to share a few pictures of my favourite outfit right now.

There are lots of different types and textures out there, from oils and balms that are great for a really good facial massage to micellar waters that are super-speedy to use (so no excuse for sleeping in makeup!). I don\u0027t believe you need to spend big money on makeup removing and cleansing, it\u0027s more about finding something that you like using and that works for your particular skin type. Having said that, I love trying new things (from all price points) to keep up to speed on what\u0027s new in the world of cleansing \u00a0- here are 5 new arrivals at the #HouseofEldridge\u2026 1. The mud cleanser - Omorovicza Moor Cream Cleanser Good for all skin types (except sensitive)\u00a0 I was given some preview samples of this to try last year. I love the brand\u0027s Deep Cleansing Mask and I was looking forward to testing this new cleanser as it uses the same Hungarian moor mud which I find works really well for my oily\/combination skin. It has quite a thick, creamy texture (but rinses off well with water and a cloth) and smells of eucalyptus and camphor - so much so that when you use it, you can breathe easier! Good if you\u0027re still feeling the effects of the winter weather. Eucalyptus also has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, so good for spot prone skin (although I\u0027d say avoid altogether if you have sensitive\/reactive skin). It doubles up as a treatment mask, I like to leave it on while I brush my teeth as a mini morning mask a couple of times a week. Available here - and I have an exclusive 20% discount code for you to use - LISAMUD20\u00a0(Available here.) If you want a similar purifying cleanser on the high street, we like Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser. It contains charcoal plus menthol so leaves skin with a similar refreshed, skin-tingly feeling. Available here. 2. The water - EKIA Cleansing Water Good for speedy cleansing on all skin types I love cleansing waters for myself and always carry some in my kit for taking off makeup quickly (and gently) between shots. This new discovery recently landed at the #HouseofEldridge\u00a0just as I was looking for a more natural alternative to Bioderma. The formula is certified organic (99.7% of the ingredients are natural origin, 68% from organic farming) so a good option if you like incorporating natural and organic products into your skincare regime. I find it removes all makeup (including eye makeup) well, great for on-the-go cleansing or if you have a late night and can\u2019t face a full \u2018at the sink\u2019 cleanse. Available here - I\u0027ve also noticed that the brand is stocked at lots of good health shops (like Holland \u0026 Barrett in the UK).

Saying that, I\u2019ve never been more excited for the arrival of March, because it definitely means that Spring is almost here! Yay for lighter, longer days! To get myself prepped for a new month, I\u2019ve got a little list of things to get through during the coming weeks\u2026 01. Get back on the beauty content! I\u2019m going to be honest here, because this is a personal blog after all. I\u2019ve been struggling lately because I (used to?) have a certain style of blog photo, and maybe even a certain style of blogging in general (lots of people do, that\u2019s why it works!) but the last six months or so I\u2019ve been feeling so deflated because there\u2019s so many exact replicas of what I create, I feel like there\u2019s truly no point. I almost feel like I\u2019m just giving them fuel to become better\u2026 it\u2019s so, so tough. This morning I got another message from someone notifying me about the same person recreating my posts, and I had a nosy to see what all the fuss was about, and I felt my stomach drop. It was eerily similar \u2013 and that\u2019s just one of many! It\u2019s hard because there\u2019s no one to govern this, so I do feel a bit like, well what\u2019s the point? Which is why I haven\u2019t uploaded much this year, or put up any beauty content in forever! I know I just need to find a new style or push on, so I\u2019m determined to get past this. Hopefully I can get ahead with my beauty posts, because I used to be so in love with blogging and photographing my beauty picks! Wish me luck\u2026 02. Wedding planning! We\u2019re absolutely no further ahead with wedding planning, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re enjoying it much! I think we\u2019re going to consider a new angle, because it\u2019s such a mission to organise something when my family are in New Zealand and Jordan\u2019s family (and our friends) are here. I\u2019ve never wanted a big wedding, and I can\u2019t even remember dreaming about my wedding day as a kid, so I know I just need to take a step back and do something we want to do, rather than the Pinterest version of a ceremony. This is the month we make actual progress, I swear! Did anyone else go through so many ups and downs during the initial planning process? 03. Yes to sun! Jordan and I are off to Tulum in Mexico at the end of the month, a little engagement present to ourselves! I love a sunny holiday but the prep I have to do before it is crazy, and I\u2019ve had to turn down four (FOUR!) trips this month (including one to New York, sob) so I can concentrate on getting things done. It\u2019ll be worth it for some time in the sun with my love though \u2013 has anyone been to Tulum? I have no idea what it\u2019ll be like, but it looks incredible. 04. Push myself. I really want to hit some goals this month \u2013 I\u2019ve upped my personal training sessions to three per week, and I\u2019m also telling myself that I\u2019m going to upload a video twice a week on my channel, and blog a whole lot more too. I love when I feel motivated and inspired in life, it just makes me want to live better and do more! I think setting myself goals is the way forward, it\u2019s always a great feeling when you reach a milestone. What have you got on this month?

A Tuesday full of positivity, one might say. To celebrate, I finally whipped up a post on my healthier pancakes, a recipe that never fails to go down a treat in this house! Whenever I\u2019m searching for or creating recipes to blog about, I\u2019m always careful of using the words \u2018healthy\u2019 or \u2018guilt-free\u2019, because everyone seems to have a differing opinion on what that means. To me, it means low in sugar, full of goodness, and oh so good for you! You can top these not-so-naughty pancakes with whatever you like, but I love the coconut and strawberry concoction I came up with on a whim! It\u2019s only two ingredients, but they go hand in hand\u2026 coconut yoghurt and strawberry jam! It\u2019s such a good pairing of flavours. I\u2019m usually a bit meh when it comes to healthier alternatives of my favourite foods, but I really think these are better than the standard pancake! Controversial, I know. Whip up a batch and let me know if you agree!   Ingredients 1 banana 2 eggs 1 cup oats 2 tbsp. ground almonds 1 tsp. baking powder 1 tsp. baking soda pinch of salt vanilla essence 1\/2 cup milk (any will do, I like oat) 1 cup coyo dairy-free coconut yoghurt 1tbsp. strawberry jam coconut flakes strawberries, chopped Method Place the oats in a food processor and give it a good blitz, then add the rest of the dry ingredients and pulse a few more times. Next, add the banana, eggs and vanilla and blitz again, before slowly adding the milk. Heat up a pan with a bit of oil or butter, and lightly fry spoonfuls of batter until golden and cooked through on each side. Once the pancakes are cooked, add a cup of coconut flakes in to the hot pan and lightly toast until golden. In a small bowl, mix the coconut yoghurt and strawberry jam until combined. Assemble your pancakes with a good helping of coconut yoghurt and strawberry mix, with fresh strawbs and a sprinkle of coconut flakes. Serve up with fresh mint tea and you\u2019re all set! A heavenly combination! Will you be making these?

Although I still haven\u2019t toned down my social life (I have at least swapped night clubs for late night, cocktail filled dinners!), I usually reserve a day for catching up on life admin! I spend a few hours tidying up my house \u2013 basically punishment for the night before \u2013 and rearranging a little, I think rearranging your rooms is a free way of getting a whole new look! While I\u2019m at it, I usually try a few little updates too\u2026 Arrange Your Kitchen Worktops I know this isn\u2019t true for everyone, but our kitchen is where we spend a lot of time! The window seat and coffee machine combo mean we often spend entire mornings catching up over endless cups of flat whites, made by the barista in the house (aka not me, I suck). Head to H\u0026M or TK MAXX and pick up some marble\/wood mix chopping boards, a jar of Pink Himalayan salt and some cute pinch pots and get to work. I also recommend hitting up Anthro for brass measuring cups and adorable trivets.  Style Your Coffee Table Our coffee table used to be a bit, er, wild\u2026 to say the least. It was cluttered with magazines, candles, remotes and hand creams \u2013 that was until one fine day I had enough and decided to give it a new lease of life. I stacked magazines neatly below, and used coffee table books to add height on top. Then I styled the candles and other bits and bobs on top. Easy peasy! Add Some Blooms In To The Mix I\u2019m a huge fan of fresh flowers, I usually use the Bloom \u0026 Wild App (I guess this is UK only, but I\u2019m sure your city will have something similar). They\u2019re pretty good with updating their bouquets regularly and they come in a few days and last aaages. Failing that, nip to your local florist and buy a bunch of eucalyptus! A lot cheaper than an entire bouquet and so pretty and freshly scented. A few small changes and your home will feel like new. Will you be trying these?

As much as I hate wishing my life away, January is a gloomy month and I\u2019m looking forward to lighter mornings and a step closer to Spring\u2026 I saw a tweet recently that said we should think of February as we would a new year, because January was a \u2018free month trial\u2019. Sounds a-okay to me, I think I take that approach every month! 01. I\u2019m starting my month in Paris, which is probably about as perfect as it gets. I\u2019m here with Bourjois learning about their new releases, so I should have some lovely content coming your way pretty soon. Is there anything you\u2019d like to see while I\u2019m here? I feel like I always go to Paris for the shortest, busiest trips, but I\u2019m sure I could put together a little something. 02. My only other trip this month (so far!) is to Edinburgh, a city I rarely venture to. I\u2019ve always found Edinburgh so busy and unbearable, but I\u2019m determined to fall in love with it. We\u2019ve booked the cutest Airbnb, and I lined up a double treatment at the Lush Spa and a cute little afternoon tea date for two. Anything else we need to try? I\u2019m going to try to fit in as much as possible. 03. My main goal of sorts this month (and hopefully beyond that!) is to get myself in to a routine! Working from home and working for myself means I find it almost impossible to have structure, and I always get thrown off by travelling so I\u2019m determined to actually push myself in to staying motivated. If anyone has any tips on this, I\u2019d love to hear them! 04. I\u2019m on to the last few jobs in this apartment of ours; I\u2019m on a mission to find cute geo-style tiles for the kitchen floor and I need to properly furnish my office! After that, I guess it\u2019s just small little bits that I will want to do leisurely. Expect some room tours coming your way asap! What have you got planned for this month?
