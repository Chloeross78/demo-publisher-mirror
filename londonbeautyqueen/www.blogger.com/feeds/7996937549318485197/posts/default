type='html'>I'm getting quite into my outfit posts. When I first started it was an odd sensation, standing in the middle of the street letting someone snap your photo and not really knowing where to look, but over the last few weeks I've definitely gotten into my stride - and developed my standard poses! It helps when you think that you're never going to see any of those curious faces again, that the streets of London are often so full of obscure goings on that a generic looking woman having her picture taken is really not going to stand out as the most memorable thing of the day. My outfits have been received so well, and you guys have been so positive, that it's definitely worth that slightly awkward hour in the street. So here's another! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--B02R2qKcOw/WLRid7EutrI/AAAAAAAAiyo/26Jt7DvJ6e4G2gtxTlD8a3Uc_qxplPQWgCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B10.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE EVENT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Myself and a few other bloggers have started to meet up every couple of weeks to catch up, discuss work plans, brainstorm and generally get inspo to keep us tied over for the following days. It's such a good way to keep your mojo strong and to connect with like-minded people (often bloggers are operating so solo that you can easily end up isolated, frustrated or lacking motivation&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;) which we tie in with a tasty brunch and even a couple of meetings. Right now the second floor cafe in Fenwicks is our fave hangout, not only because of the tasty food and super accommodating staff who let us take over a booth for a day, but because you can always celeb spot: last time we had lunch across the way from Joan Collins! These shots were taken a stone's throw away from New Bond Street, where there are so many beautiful old fashioned buildings and flowers blooming as we step into spring. A few doors down is the iconic Claridges, so I was in pretty good company for the afternoon - and the decor even matched my outfit! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5Qm-CPWnLy8/WLRlG4P69qI/AAAAAAAAizo/QQLSddD2aIcpD8dg45XBlcjb3IXx7toVQCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cOI0FvhOT0A/WLRk-3YWswI/AAAAAAAAizk/GCNEfF30ZtE_54QjkAQzJmNAxbUZGCULgCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VRB_iXm8C7U/WLRiqsPqOSI/AAAAAAAAiyw/UOvS9hY7T-Q0zB7YwLqkzOyNuWfuRF3dQCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2EN2QaMnBMA/WLRjvq5H_KI/AAAAAAAAizI/Xfe_hr3KcCYzHiQcF5bFLbhPD3aR9NPIACLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE OUTFIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I have to admit this entire look has been re-hashed from things I've had in my wardrobe for an age and completely forgotten about; isn't that the best feeling, when you rediscover something and repurpose it into a brand new look?&amp;nbsp; The skirt is Topshop, bought a couple of years ago, and is equally great with a t-shirt in the summer as with tights and a jumper in the winter; because it's very volumous and made of a thick sweater-like material, it keeps you warm but also keeps you cool too. The jumper is a cheapo number from Primark, but the crop styles work so well with skirts (I hate having to tuck things in) that it's worth trawling through their displays to find a gem, while the shoes are last year's ASOS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these sparkly loafers after falling in love with them online, but when I first started to wear them they ripped my feet to shreds: I'd have to strategically plan where I was going and how much I was working if I wanted to wear them, as they were so blooming uncomfortable. However, when I rediscovered them at the bottom of my shoe basket this year they'd mysteriously become super comfy; I'll never understand the magic that means uncomfortable shoes miraculously become worn in without you even realising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fave addition to any outfit though is my trusty Oasis leather jacket, which goes with absolutely everything. I adore the material, it's oh so comfy, plus it only gets better with age; it softens a super structured outfit, funks up a girlie look or makes your jeans-and-tee combo always seem more interesting. Personally I love putting it with a slightly more 'office appropriate' combo to relax the overall effect, while keeping me warm and covered up. You just can't go wrong with a leather jacket can you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IA22zkoYcX0/WLRiji8S7-I/AAAAAAAAiys/hsC4-U04sNgSY5d932eyQ2AMWs4pzUUggCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B11.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/---PIIfXrVDM/WLRjWW5D1bI/AAAAAAAAiy0/LAqN38VhCSY_OO9CFkp_BDnzIH2g1GfQwCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B12.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7PK5kL4MydQ/WLRjzTL5CKI/AAAAAAAAizM/OEeq3s1lDt48eTXWU7ja3pz4bqAltrR-QCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B8.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8UQR6v4Rs0E/WLRjoKMamSI/AAAAAAAAizA/bIk7xlHM9Woa8NkvC3ckQjEBRp9WdJBCgCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B16.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Palt4HrCj3I/WLRjh4lgTQI/AAAAAAAAiy8/kgO3HIXXx9srjktDC4vtqQyOkEpCncFxwCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B15.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6uiSXhkZFfw/WLRj6Zi4UFI/AAAAAAAAizU/YDG3teUBQ7YdeR31KBRizIgCKWb3L5QVwCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B17.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE ACCESSORIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My current fave bag, the Givenchy Antigona, has been making numerous appearances since I picked it up in Bicester Village for a third off.&amp;nbsp; It's such a great size (it fits in all my stuff - including a camera, my book and a makeup bag) without feeling like I'm carrying around a suitcase; I've only had it a month or so but it's the best investment I've made in a long time. Even better is that it matches my leather jacket perfectly! In addition to the bag, a great pair of sunnies helps to keep a look casual whilst phasing you into the new season; right now there's a lot of sun even when it's still chilly, so a simple pair of &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2mGkhuo" target="_blank"&gt;black sunglasses&lt;/a&gt; is an essential in my Givenchy. This pair are an ASOS bargain at only £14.00, but look a lot more expensive thanks to the high-fashion brow bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my wrists are also my current favourite things: two rose gold engraved bracelets bought for me by my fiancé. The first &lt;a href="http://www.beaverbrooks.co.uk/0104512/Silver-Rose-Gold-Plated-Bar-Bracelet/p" target="_blank"&gt;rectangular bracelet&lt;/a&gt; is engraved with the date we met and is from Beaverbrooks, the double bracelet detail making it a little different and making a subtle statement. I didn't know that Beaverbrooks engraved, but they have a whole range of jewellery that can be personalised for free - so if you fancy it it's well worth a look. The &lt;a href="http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/bloomboutique/product/personalised-inital-double-disk-bracelet" target="_blank"&gt;second bracelet&lt;/a&gt; is engraved with our initials and was bought from Not On The High Street as my Valentines gift, which matches perfectly with the one I got for my birthday a few months prior. I've never been super fussed about expensive jewellery, but I do adore pieces that are personalised and mean something - both of these are just the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, another beautiful number from Henry London who is fast becoming my favourite watch brand. This &lt;a href="https://www.henry-london.com/shop/womens-watches/finchley-hl34-ss-0200" target="_blank"&gt;dark grey strap&lt;/a&gt; is great for this time of year, when you want something dark without opting for black, while the rose gold detailing is refreshingly a perfect match for all my current most loved jewellery. They have a huge selection of styles and colours, all beautifully crafted to provide something you'll cherish for years to come (or change up every season if you're a bit of a watch fiend!) Make sure you check them out online.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--TXaMAa_qpI/WLRl4ksgDwI/AAAAAAAAizw/WAuW7hCr_ocb4ddd-RBM0IM7o57Hc9tTgCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B18.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G29iy_DOLLU/WLRjdQjYxcI/AAAAAAAAiy4/-e6qlDCB2_4uPa_TuXRuc0RO_qPlCi0yQCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B14.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ssxmxeuAwzU/WLRkzs7j0HI/AAAAAAAAizg/83ddjjtjtioVypD8yKRDHMIUbEAHRRUHwCLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B20.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6Fpm5Xfiang/WLRj270rKAI/AAAAAAAAizQ/s4QrWrfOkdAIvczaT2c1a2LLCHdwlwNwACLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B13.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ivCIzDwOhP4/WLRjsGmfhVI/AAAAAAAAizE/KfnZHg0Z6QsA9AIHklzFzP3SnixwJ_p3ACLcB/s1600/OOTD%2BSpots%2B%2526%2BSparkles%2B%2528And%2BA%2BLeather%2BJacket%2BGoes%2BWith%2BEverything%2529%2B%2B5.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;I hope you like my look!

There's something nostalgic and incredibly comforting about the scent of our favourite childhood confectionery, especially as our sense of smell has been proven to be a powerful force in the formation of memory and emotion. For me there's nothing more comforting than the subtle scent of Palma Violets or breathing in the aroma of a Lemon Bon Bon, which is why I'm a little obsessed with Patisserie De Bain and all the sweet body treats they have on offer. (I even named their &lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/2015/04/product-of-week-patisserie-de-bain.html" target="_blank"&gt;hand creams&lt;/a&gt; my 'product of the week' back in 2015!) Not only are their formulations a pleasure to use, but they've managed to capture everything we love about candy shops without presenting a range that airs on the side of childish and sickly sweet; it's a grown up way to celebrate our love for all things sugary - but without the calories!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I7dl8ITcglI/WLQBofZtJ0I/AAAAAAAAiyI/hz5Y4qvtPAwuuXeUT4_EpX2r2AHw-XTJACEw/s1600/Satisfy%2BYour%2BSweet%2BTooth%2BWith%2BPatisserie%2BDe%2BBain%2527s%2BNEW%2BRhubarb%2B%2526%2BCustard%2BScent%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm a big fan of their hand creams already, but this March they're releasing a brand new fragrance that has got me all in a tizz: Rhubarb &amp;amp; Custard. The scent of the classic little boiled sweets has been bottled and magically injected into a nourishing hand cream, so you can treat your hands to a pampering while simultaneously invigorating your senses. You can't apply this without a smile creeping across your face - especially as the magicians at Patisserie De Bain have managed to get the fragrance absolutely spot on. This could have ended up sugary sweet and a little overpowering, but in fact it has a scent that's practically indistinguishable from the real thing! The cream itself is really nourishing and creamy while still absorbing really fast to leave a silky soft finish; I love the fact I can use it while working and not have creamy fingerprints all over my laptop, or pop it on mid conversation and not have to massage my hands for ten minutes to get it all to sink in. (Within five seconds it's gone, just leaving soft hands behind in its place.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patisserie De Bain have nailed this new scent and I know that you guys will love it as much as me. It's the perfect desk-side essential or handbag treat, giving you a little sugary pick-me-up for body and mind when you need it most.

As strange as that sounds, I'm incredibly excited for Josh and I to enter this next chapter of our lives together and to see what the next few decades have in store. To all of you that have expressed your congratulations and left kind comments, thank you; it means a great deal and has made this period even more special for us. As a moment in time many of us look to as a memory to be cherished forever, an engagement in reality is quite strange and surreal: here I am with a ring on my finger, a pile of brochures and an email addressed to a registrar, but it doesn't quite seem like I'm looking towards one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. Right now it feels like I've simply got a big old sparkler on my hand and I'm having fun organising an almighty party for our loved ones. We've cracked open the champagne and told the tale oodles of times, I've shared snaps on my Instagram account and we've received so many lovely cards and gifts, so I thought it was about time I shared my story here - both as a way to remember it for years to come and to let you into an area of my life that's set to become all consuming in the following months. So here it is... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RsF8pso8DoY/WLBQj13_HjI/AAAAAAAAiww/v2ULaKwXg-cKVsPulsMXyMozKMEToaOYgCLcB/s1600/My%2Bengagement%2Bstory%2Bring%2Bwedding%2Bplanning%2B1%2B.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;PICKING THE RING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Choosing a ring that will adorn your hand for the rest of your days is a daunting task for anybody, especially for a guy who doesn't understand the first thing about jewellery. Although many women dream about their perfect dress or the ultimate cake, for me it's always been about the ring; for a long time (before I even met Josh) I've known exactly the kind of thing I wanted, which was cemented a few years ago when I took a trip to Amsterdam's Diamond Museum with a girlfriend. As we were the only two in the store the shop assistant insisted that we both try on everything in sight; my preference has always been a princess cut halo diamond, and that was undoubtedly the style that seemed to suit my hand best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to choosing a ring, we'd spoken about getting married so many times before (and googled endless pictures for reference) that Josh knew the kind of direction to go in. However, with thousands of options to choose from it's no surprise that he got in a bit of a muddle and asked for help. My personal belief has always been that I'd prefer to be involved in the decision making process to ensure I had something I utterly adored, rather than chance him coming under a huge amount of pressure and picking something less than perfect. So we went shopping...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was never our intention to go out for a first look and come back with a chosen (albeit yet to be purchased) ring, but that's what happened. Originally I wanted a bespoke ring made for me to my exact requirements, but the timescale and faff involved started to put me off. Having tried every single ring in one particular retailer, I knew what what suited my hand and what was utterly out of the question. What's interesting and important to know is that some rings just don't look right on your hand, whether they're too big/too flat/too dull, so you have to try them all to get a clearer understanding of what works. (I thought I wanted a piece of mega bling, but when I put on a certain ring Josh's exact words were "it looks like it came out of a Christmas cracker." It was so big and so sparkly that it ended up looking like a piece of cosmetic jewellery; not ideal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a firm believer in fate (cemented by the way we met, which you can read about if you're interested &lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/2016/06/our-love-story.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,) and my ring and I were meant to be. It was the last ring I tried on in the last shop - and I wasn't even intending to go in, but thought I'd tick it off just to make sure I'd covered all bases. It wasn't even one I'd chosen myself, but it recommended by the sales assistant who popped it on my finger to try; it was the perfect style, the perfect fit, the perfect size, the perfect sparkle and even had 20% off as a special promotion. Instantly I got goosepimples and knew it was the one (and Josh was just pretty happy he'd be saving 20%.) That was it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PROPOSAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A few months after we chose the ring (and Josh secretly bought it) came the exciting part... Our first 'proper' date was on the London Eye, where we watched the sun set over the landscape and took in the incredible views. On the evening we got engaged, Josh had booked a restaurant that overlooked the Thames and the Eye (a special significance that I didn't realise until later.) There's no major story here and I don't want to go into the super personal details, but suffice to say we had a lovely evening - but the ring was yet to make an appearance. It wasn't until we got home that I knew something was up when Josh started to be soppier and more reflective than usual, eventually blindfolding me so he could get the gigantic ring box from out of his hiding place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reference to our favourite film, 'Back To The Future' Josh nervously asked me if I'd be his 'partner in time' while I (think) I grinned from ear to ear. After he finally got down on his knees to ask the question properly, I realised the size of the box was so gigantic that there was no way he could've hidden that in his jeans or coat pocket (a major flaw Mr Jeweller!) I'd always had the perception that rings come in little tiny boxes that can easily be concealed, but this one was so big it was about as subtle as a box of cereal. Hearing the words 'will you marry me' is such an odd and emotional experience and I reacted by bursting into tears and flinging my arms around Josh; he reacted by not even knowing which finger he should be putting it on! Men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WEDDING PLANNING&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So here we are. We're looking forward to the next few months as we plan our Big Day and enjoy all the trappings that come with it. We've got a date, a venue and a plan of action (as well as a tonne of Pinterest boards) so I'm going to thoroughly immerse myself in the process and enjoy every moment. The last couple of weeks have been spent googling, pinning and mentally scrapbooking and I think we both now know exactly what we want; being on the same page and having the same expectations certainly makes things easier, as there are no big decisions to make. Over the next six months or so I'll undoubtedly be sharing snippets and advice I learn, as well as bits and bobs after the big event; I want to be able to document the whole experience for not only ourselves, but for our future generations too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been looking all over the internet for advice and words of wisdom (of which too much is fluff and not enough practical suggestion,) I also want to be able to hopefully help any future brides reading this and reassure you that there's no need to stress or worry. Although getting married is a complicated business (and so much of it relies on confirming only a few details,) it's fun and hopefully a once-in-a-lifetime thing that should be cherished. Here's to a new chapter, a whole new bundle of content and to spending lots of money on a tonne of stuff we probably don't need...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of love, the future Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Hall xx &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I3OWOoiiumI/WLBQayHMAgI/AAAAAAAAiws/YyZe33SDRYMN4Mea9PaioNu9xKZaX55kgCLcB/s1600/My%2Bengagement%2Bstory%2Bring%2Bwedding%2Bplanning%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--xwZcqnbZEc/WLBTNI9PpxI/AAAAAAAAixE/5k8_EzRmcJsTiOCZDgSkaax_VmHYtVUCQCLcB/s1600/engagement%2Bring%2Bstory%2Bwedding%2Bplanning%2B.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

It's become a destination in its own right because of the purity of the colour scheme and the quality of the items within, but until now they've kept their focus very much to homewares. I was surprised to find out that the founder of The White Company was originally a beauty journalist and therefore incredibly passionate about skincare, so it makes complete sense that this year the brand are trying their hand at launching a capsule range of beauty products that very much fit within their ethos of minimalistic and aspirational shopping. Rather interestingly they've partnered with Deciem (who really know their stuff - they're the people behind The Ordinary, Niod, Hylamide, Fountain and Hand Chemistry) to bring this collection to life; if  you want the industry to stand up and take notice, then these are  undoubtedly the guys you'd turn to for help. Using their expertise to develop a collection that consists of a cleansing balm, night oil, moisturiser, concentrated serum and eye treatment, the result is a five piece line-up that provides a great basis for any skincare regime. But is it worth the hype, and more importantly the price? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uTMnvjdXVHM/WK8b9N9g_8I/AAAAAAAAiv0/Nr0E2R0FXPsXuoYTpp_3EqrBXhoyVz67ACEw/s1600/The%2BWhite%2BCompany%2BLaunch%2BA%2BCapsule%2BSkincare%2BCollection%2B%2528But%2BIs%2BIt%2BWorth%2BThe%2BPrice%2BTag%2529%2B%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The stripped back approach to skincare they've developed matches the brand aesthetic completely,&amp;nbsp; remaining in-keeping with their approach to everything from candles to bed throws. There's no fluff or faff, just a range of easy-to-use and incredibly beautiful formulas that will undoubtedly appeal to The White Company customers old and new; even the packaging is simple, elegant and timeless - ensuring that this appeals as much to a 25 year old as a 65 year old. Although the capsule collection is somewhat refreshing, it does mean if you want a more bespoke skincare regime or have specific needs that you'll need to look elsewhere - or at least add in a product or two from perhaps the standalone Deciem ranges. Let's take a closer look at each in turn... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2ldEqYc" target="_blank"&gt;SUPER SERUM&lt;/a&gt; £40.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring  a blend of grape vine stem cells, protein-rich amino acids, green-tea  and marine extracts, this intelligent serum offers protection against UV  damage and ageing while also helping it to look plumper, smoother and  more even. This is probably my favourite from the range, as it's  incredibly light and more like an oil than a serum; my skin soaks it up  within a few seconds, leaving a pretty radiant complexion behind that's  ready for my moisturiser. It's a great all-rounder for all ages, but you  will need a touch more punch if you're wanting to tackle any bigger  issues than 'I just want to look after my skin.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lK8UUJ" target="_blank"&gt;ADVANCED HYDRATION&lt;/a&gt; £30.00 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blended with an advanced form of hyaluronic acid, nourishing Amazonian oils and soothing aloe-vera butter, this lightweight moisturiser is non-greasy and absorbs quickly to leave skin feeling hydrated and comfortable. It's delicately scented with lavender, rose and orange essential oils to make the experience evocative (although the lavender puts me to sleep a little!) and luxurious, but despite that it's a relatively standard moisturiser. In my opinion the price is a little steep considering the amount of product you get, and the downside is that I'm a little disappointed there's no dressing-table appropriate pot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lKaA0G" target="_blank"&gt;EYE REVIVE&lt;/a&gt; £20.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ultra-light gel formula claims to diminish the appearance of dark circles, visibly reduce puffiness and helps to lift the upper eyelids. It's definitely cooling and pleasurable to apply, and thanks to a blend of Persian silk tree, oxygen-boosting actives and probiotic technology there's the possibility that it could actually brighten over time too - but again, it doesn't provide the immediate difference I look for and it's not amazing enough for me to stick with over a longer period of time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2ldyXAF" target="_blank"&gt;SUPER BALM&lt;/a&gt; £25.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cleansing balm that's designed to deeply, yet gently, cleanse and dissolve all traces of make-up while instantly boosting hydration, this is a great staple for anyone that needs a good cleanser at the end of a long day. It starts as a cream, melts into a lightweight balm upon contact with the skin, and then emulsifies when mixed with water to leave a creamy cleanse behind. You get a lot of product for your money too, making this a relatively affordable and effective option that I wouldn't think twice about recommending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lKlnb1" target="_blank"&gt;NIGHT OIL&lt;/a&gt; £30.00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formulated with an enriching blend of Amazonian oils, anti-oxidants and poppy-flower extract to ensure that you'll awake with deeply nourished, super soft and firmer-looking skin, this night oil smells delicious and is a great texture for those nervous about applying oils. Although it's certainly pleasurable, I don't think there's anything groundbreaking going on here so you'll definitely be investing in more of a sensorial experience rather than hardcore skincare - but if that's your bag, you'll love it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the range is great to use and provides a simple approach to skincare, but it's not rocking my world. I feel like you're definitely paying a premium for it being in White Company packaging, rather than for what's inside; my main concern with this range is the fact that partnering with Deciem means that you can get the same level of expertise and quality of ingredient from them directly - for a much cheaper price point. (The Ordinary starts at only a fiver, and if you know how to use it the range will be a life changer.) It's the perfect addition for the usual customer that pops into The White Company for a bathrobe or Christening gift and I completely understand why they've made this brand extension, but for those of us that expect great things from their skincare product it may be worth investing your cash elsewhere. (Or just picking up a load of Deciem instead.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think about The White Company's skincare range? A great addition, or a waste of money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HhcdoODUrNw/WK9NJ60t30I/AAAAAAAAiwQ/TdBZKSTM1l8uuADkol9FTdu-58un617-ACLcB/s1600/The%2BWhite%2BCompany%2BLaunch%2BA%2BCapsule%2BSkincare%2BCollection%2B%2528But%2BIs%2BIt%2BWorth%2BThe%2BPrice%2BTag%2529%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TdEHSarOQ-w/WK9NJjTmMuI/AAAAAAAAiwM/V2z2wg8xS88eB-rR821znuM_oNulToY_wCLcB/s1600/The%2BWhite%2BCompany%2BLaunch%2BA%2BCapsule%2BSkincare%2BCollection%2B%2528But%2BIs%2BIt%2BWorth%2BThe%2BPrice%2BTag%2529%2B%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The White Company &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2l8X2IQ" target="_blank"&gt;skincare collection&lt;/a&gt; ranges from £20.00-£40.00 and is available in stores and online.

Having a healthy, radiant, powerful pout can mean the difference between feeling on top of the world and feeling like you'd rather stay in bed - that's why we're collectively so obsessed with the power of a great red lipstick! However, it's easy to become complacent when it comes to your lips (and neglect them in favour of anything from your under-eye circles to your cuticles,) as we don't often notice there's an issue until its too late. Whether that's dryness, irritation, lack of plumpness (or god forbid a coldsore!) by the time our bodies tell us somethings up we're forced to go into full-on war room mode; so what if there were things you could do to make a long-term difference, ensuring your pout was always preened and perfect? Here are five of my top tips to ensure your lips are healthy and kissable all year long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SEYPgWyMfYc/WK2YtWKQ26I/AAAAAAAAiuo/VEMeDyzfc7Mcyx2FgB4LcITcurzewKW8QCLcB/s1600/How%2BTo%2BEnsure%2BHealthy%2BKissable%2BLips%2BAll%2BYear%2BLong%2B%2528While%2BPreventing%2BThose%2BCold%2BSores%2BFrom%2BAppearing%2521%2529%2B%2B7.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;APPLY LIPIVIR TO PREVENT COLD SORES&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've experienced my fair share of cold sores over the years and they're never fun. Once they've appeared they leave your lips uncomfortable, sore, crusty and visually a little bit bleugh - and most importantly, they prevent you from applying the products you want to use. Cold sores can zap your confidence and leave you wanting to hide away, but thankfully lipivir have created something to help. Applying a small amount around the edge of lips both morning and night can help prevent the appearance of cold sores, even up to that first tingle. The HSV1 virus that causes cold sores reactivates by sending signals between particles to ‘wake-up’ and start replicating so they can spread; lipivir has a special formulation that disrupts these signals so they don’t arrive. lts special formula is made of different polymers of ethylene glycol (a biologically&amp;nbsp;inactive substance which interferes with the signals) ‘jamming’ the viruses’ communications and preventing outbreaks. Clever eh? Pop it by your toothbrush so you remember to apply every time you brush your teeth!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;USE A SOOTHING LIP BALM&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Many of the lipglosses and lipsticks we use are enriched with ingredients that can irritate or dry out the surface of lips; if you've ever applied a red lipstick multiple times in one day, you'll be very familiar with the sensation! Investing in a great lip balm that will help replenish lost moisture and inject goodness into the skin (through ingredients such as Vitamin E, coconut oil, beeswax or shea butter) will ensure you've always got a helping hand at your side. Pop one in your bag and on your desk so you can top up throughout the day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BUFF THOSE LIPS ONCE A WEEK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Exfoliating away a build-up of dry and dead skin cells will help rejuvinate the skin beneath, while encouraging blood to rise to the surface (providing a more youthful and plump appearance.) Whether you want to make your own scrub with a touch of sugar and coconut oil, or opt for a shop-bought version, make sure you buff the formula gently over lips once a week (or after you've been wearing lipstick) to leave your pout feeling fresh and smooth. Finish off with a dab of balm too soothe.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TREAT &amp;amp; PAMPER OVERNIGHT&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just like with our skin, our lips can benefit from a little overnight pampering. While our bodies are in 'go slow' mode they can focus more on repair, putting products to work effectively so you awake rejuvinated. Apply either a thick layer of your usual lip balm or moisturiser before bed, so it can work to soothe and hydrate as you slumber; if you're a regular lipstick wearer then this is also the perfect way to ensure your lips are always the perfect blank canvas ready to be painted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;INVEST IN A HUMIDIFIER&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Rather surprisingly, dry air can also dry out your lips - especially in the winter when the air can be dryer and our lips are exposed to cold winds. Investing in a humidifier to place in rooms where you spend a lot of time (such as your living room or bedroom) will help to infuse more moisture into the air; popping it on while you sleep will boost the performance of your products, while ensuring the delicate top layers are plumped full of moisture. I've had one of these in my bedroom for around a year and it's definitely helped prevent dryness and left my skin feeling fab. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it's a little late for resolutions, I'm definitely going to try and treat my lips a little kinder throughout 2017. One of my best friends suffers from horrendous cold sores and self confidence issues when they erupt, so I'm passing on my tips (along with a few tubes of lipivir) to see if it helps. Nobody should have to suffer with dry, irritated or sore lips - but luckily help is at hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jarl-3S81vg/WK2YuNGbkoI/AAAAAAAAius/YGgL1mfvVP0cFLS-sl61cdK--H1juQYngCEw/s1600/How%2BTo%2BEnsure%2BHealthy%2BKissable%2BLips%2BAll%2BYear%2BLong%2B%2528While%2BPreventing%2BThose%2BCold%2BSores%2BFrom%2BAppearing%2521%2529%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f1OgtiwXjho/WK2YqZ8w9WI/AAAAAAAAiuc/IeZwYw0NrBMd1j4LxYWUloq2fhNY6lsfQCEw/s1600/How%2BTo%2BEnsure%2BHealthy%2BKissable%2BLips%2BAll%2BYear%2BLong%2B%2528While%2BPreventing%2BThose%2BCold%2BSores%2BFrom%2BAppearing%2521%2529%2B%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SEYPgWyMfYc/WK2YtWKQ26I/AAAAAAAAiuo/XnvEnbmO_hA9ZI9mSJZKmVhMLj1vgAGjQCEw/s1600/How%2BTo%2BEnsure%2BHealthy%2BKissable%2BLips%2BAll%2BYear%2BLong%2B%2528While%2BPreventing%2BThose%2BCold%2BSores%2BFrom%2BAppearing%2521%2529%2B%2B7.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OdIbwqRFtpM/WK2YqZcy6xI/AAAAAAAAiug/RWi75v1BfcIrzEfSA0ren0NXfghYwFnnQCEw/s1600/How%2BTo%2BEnsure%2BHealthy%2BKissable%2BLips%2BAll%2BYear%2BLong%2B%2528While%2BPreventing%2BThose%2BCold%2BSores%2BFrom%2BAppearing%2521%2529%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find out more about lipivir, visit their website: &lt;a href="http://www.lipivir.com/"&gt;www.lipivir.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also follow them on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lipivir" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lipiviruk" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a sponsored post on behalf of lipivir; all opinions and recommendations are my own.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Historically skincare has always been the dull side of the beauty industry, with the focus very much being on game-changing makeup or instantly transformative haircare, but over the last decade our opinions have been transformed. As we collectively seek out ways to ensure our complexion remains radiant, healthy and strong throughout our lives (and the focus very much being on keeping those signs of ageing at bay for as long as possible,) skincare provides the tools we need to make a difference. Previous generations may have relied on soap, water and a little pot of cold cream, but now we’re turning to the most advanced science we can find - and integrating upwards of eight steps into our morning regime. Like with anything us consumers can get our hands on, the assumption is that ‘you get what you pay for’ and we should all be turning to super expensive lotions and skipping the budget potions altogether. However, if you know what to look for and how to shop your product portfolio doesn’t have to set you back the price of a designer handbag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IwY9cGp1PB0/WK1wJxfF3rI/AAAAAAAAitc/ZB-F69SWBiEAOoPiYybekXlaeGh0LO6DgCLcB/s1600/Why%2BOwn%2BBrand%2BSkincare%2BIs%2BThe%2BSecret%2BAffordable%252C%2BYet%2BEffective%252C%2BOption%2BFor%2BAll%2BBudgets%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Own brand skincare has always had a bit of a reputation for being naff, ineffective and something you’d rather hide away in your bathroom; often the design of the packaging, marketing and information behind it doesn’t exactly help either. When presented with a relatively plain looking pack versus a super luxurious pot, which would you rather choose? However, often own branded skincare has been developed with the same science and within the same labs as some of the most expensive and aspirational brands - you just don’t pay the premium for that brand name and fancy pot. Unless a brand is part of a huge conglomerate, they tend to outsource their product development to other companies and utilise existing technology to develop the next ‘groundbreaking’ serum or face cream. (In fact Boots have a huge UK plant where they develop too many of the high street names to mention; you’d never know it was essentially all the same stuff unless you knew where to look!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s interesting (and rather exciting) is that some of the ‘own brand’ skincare is therefore just as good as stuff that will set you back three times the price, because it’s developed in the same labs by the same people and often even produced in the same factories. The difference is that because that brand doesn’t have to pay themselves up to a 60% margin for the privilege of being sold in their stores (Boots/Superdrug/Tesco etc all buy in products at an average of 40% of the retail price, allowing themselves a tidy profit,) they can focus on creating the best product while keeping the price point down. That’s why Boots No7 is clinically proven to be so effective, but remains incredibly affordable; similarly, that’s why Superdrug’s own brand skincare is receiving increasing industry praise while often costing less than a tenner. Even brands including Avon and M&amp;amp;S have some beautiful products that really make a difference to skin, but you may never think to turn to them because of the perception you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it’s become socially acceptable to hunt out a bargain or admit to buying that stellar dress from Matalan, the perception of own brand skincare is starting to change - which is great for both our complexions and our purses. If you look past the brand name and the (usually) rather dull packaging, you may find yourself a little gem that works just as hard as something super premium. Need a place to start during your weekend shop? Here are some of my personal fave affordable and effective skincare own brand products. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/no7-protect-and-perfect-intense-advanced-serum-50ml-10184269" target="_blank"&gt;Boots No7 Protect &amp;amp; Perfect Advanced Serum&lt;/a&gt; (£32.95) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinically proven to reduce the signs of ageing, these products were truly groundbreaking when they first launched and caused a stampede of women to form in stores nationwide after being featured on TV. They’re pleasurable to use, have been formulated for different age ranges and don’t cost you an arm and a leg. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Day-Cream-Moisturisers/B-Radiant-Day-Cream-50ml/p/470404" target="_blank"&gt;Superdrug ‘B’ Radiant/Nourished Day Cream&lt;/a&gt; (£10.99)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great range that's clinically proven to deliver results in only four weeks, this day cream is light enough to apply under makeup while still providing the hydration skin needs. Both my Mum and Nan but this range to the test a couple of years ago and loved everything about it; they genuinely thought it had made a difference to their skin and assumed it was some super-dooper expensive brand. (They tried it blind for four weeks. &lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/2014/12/putting-bskincare-to-test-amazing.html" target="_blank"&gt;See the results in my post here&lt;/a&gt;!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.avon.uk.com/product/302-331-4074/skincare/anti-ageing/anew-ultimate-supreme-dual-elixir" target="_blank"&gt;Anew Ultimate Supreme Dual Elixir&lt;/a&gt; (£20.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining the power of two individual formulas in one pump (both an oil and serum,) this formula includes black pearls and gold peptides to help purify skin cells, provide a protective moisture barrier and reverse the signs of ageing. It's a real pleasure to use and feels way more expensive than the £20.00 price point, proving you don't have to stretch to Elizabeth Arden prices if you don't want to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2l41zMS" target="_blank"&gt;M&amp;amp;S Absolute Ultimate Sleep Cream&lt;/a&gt; (£22.00) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One  of the very few products I’ve used to the very last drop, this  beautifully formulated overnight treatment helps to leave skin radiant  and refreshed - while tackling those signs of ageing over time. Not only  does it feel incredibly luxurious, but I knew every night I used this  that I didn’t have to worry how I’d look the following day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever used own brand skincare? Have you always had a perception that it’s not as good as more expensive counterparts, or does branding not bother you at all? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

We reveled in being able to share our loves and loathes, provide honest feedback on our purchases and discuss issues that were important to us; opinions were at the heart of the bloggersphere and absolutely what made it stand out amongst the run-of-the-mill and diluted glossiness of magazines. Collectively we had turned against mainstream media as we couldn't necessarily trust the opinions and edits presented to us, especially when big brands and mega budgets were having an increasingly negative impact on the information between the covers. Bloggers were honest, transparent and not afraid to share exactly what they thought; a week didn't go by without one of us getting a 'cease and desist' letter from a brand that didn't like what we had to say, and were using their legal teams to scare us into censoring opinions. It was brilliant. It was wonderful. It was a turning point in time. Not everyone loved the same things or had the same opinions on a new launch, but that was ok - because that was a reflection of what was happening in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m-1LVTmbi0o/WKr_aF01QcI/AAAAAAAAisk/GLm5vFzlGNgNJGZkVZovCC1afrcv6nFGQCLcB/s1600/Beauty%2BPie%2BA%2BRevolutionary%2BNew%2BConcept%2BFor%2BMakeup%2BLovers%252C%2BBut%2BDoes%2BIt%2BMake%2BFinancial%2BSense%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I like to refer to this as the 'golden age' of blogging: before it became as glossy, edited and mainstream as the media we were rebelling against. Over the last decade the bloggersphere has evolved (both positively and negatively) to the point that it's almost unrecogniseable from where we started; the editorial style of writing, fashion magazine standard photography and beautifully curated social media feeds that make every 20-something look like their living the life of Gigi Hadid are just the tip of the iceberg. The big issue? As a veteran of the blogging world I'm increasingly aware and concerned about the lack of real opinion - it's like the industry has become too scared to provide insight that's not 100% positive, or to share thoughts that aren't always 'on brand'. You can find literally thousands of cookie cutter blogs out there, but very few of them offer insight or comment beyond 'I love it!/It's so pretty!/This is a must-have!' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the growth of the blogging community I understand that we're all in constant competition for the latest product sample, press trip or sponsored campaign (and that often playing it safe provides higher return in the short term.) I understand that brands want you to say nice things about their products, because their end objective is to make as many sales as possible. However, what I don't understand is why so many within the bloggersphere are happy to ride the safe train at the expense of their reader. In the words of Caroline Hirons during &lt;a href="http://www.carolinehirons.com/2017/02/newness-updates-opinions.html" target="_blank"&gt;a recent post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"God forbid you say you didn’t get on with something. God forbid you use your platform to give your readers genuine feedback on an experience, even when it’s done so constructively and without resorting to blanket negativity. Having an opinion does not make you a bitch, and it certainly should not make you ashamed." &lt;/i&gt;Amen Hirons, amen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital space has successfully evolved into something aspirational, motivational and incredibly curated, but in my opinion this has been at the expense of raw and unedited opinion - which is why we all started in the first place. We're on very dangerous ground right now as blogs become increasingly fluffy and bland. I find myself continually fighting to be recognised as an intelligent woman with a well-rounded background and informed opinion, but when there are so many others out there focusing on the prettiness of their online space rather than what impact their words have, it becomes somewhat of a losing battle. Super styled beauty images, professionally shot outfits and hired locations that wouldn't look out of place on the pages of Vogue are great, but it's also important for us to use the power of the written (or spoken) word to make positive change or share valuable opinion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an example, recently a new beauty concept launched into the UK under the name of 'Beauty Pie'; this subscription platform seemed great on the surface, but when you started to scratch away and look deeper there were a number of issues and problematic areas that needed addressing as part of a comprehensive review. (&lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/2016/12/beauty-pie-revolutionary-new-concept.html" target="_blank"&gt;You can read my full feature here&lt;/a&gt;.) What concerned me was the number of features that praised the service as something revolutionary and overwhelmingly positive, without letting readers know about the potential pitfalls (of which there were many.) I've literally read hundreds of articles on the concept, but could probably count on my hands the number of sites that dared to say anything negative (or worse, even bothered to do their own research rather than just repeating what was on the press release.) Everyone is free to give their opinion and share their own thoughts (positive, negative or neutral) because that's the whole point of the bloggersphere, but when there's no opinion at all? That's when it becomes worrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel incredibly uneasy about the future of blogging right now, because I think we're in serious danger of becoming as edited and vacuous as the magazines that we're supposed to be replacing. Too many are focused on whether everything is 'on brand' for them, rather than using their voice and influence to impart knowledge or advice; too many are worried about losing out on that next press trip or bundle of free lipsticks, rather than focusing on creating a strong persona that their readers can relate to. Too many of us are being shot down for having an opinion or told that we should just get back to talking about lipsticks, while the blogging elite are focused on their next big pay rather than whether they would genuinely recommend a product without it. I've always made it a priority to share my true thoughts and bring you an honest account of my experiences; a great brand will understand that not everyone will adore every product, and a reader won't expect you to. Opinions are vital to the bloggersphere and how it operates, but they seem to now be as rare as a limited edition Mariah Carey lipstick. I think it's about time we brought them back...&lt;br /&gt;But you know, that's just my opinion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;What do you think about the scarcity of opinions within the bloggersphere right now? Does it concern or worry you? Have you noticed a change over the last few years, or do the sites you follow continue to tell it how it is - no holds barred? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

The first few months are a bit dry when it comes to exciting launches, but all of a sudden it's like the beauty industry wakes up after a winter kip and starts delivering little nuggets of brilliance. We have to get the first few weeks out of the way, dodge the pinkness of Valentines and focus on the other side of Mother's Day before the good stuff starts happening - but already we're starting to see little trickles of sunlight. Thankfully there are hot bits landing that are worth knowing about, some launches that you'll be coveting and collections that will leave you wondering whether you can justify yet another one of those... These are the ten pieces I'm excited to share with you and think you'll be wanting to add to your shopping list this weekend. You've been warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mugD9V4W9wY/WKcMsXaauuI/AAAAAAAAiqY/Bzr_TS8LjlApdd8G1ADLFTcXsKpWxB9DQCEw/s1600/New%2BIn%2BThsi%2BWeek%2Baveeno%2Bmillerharris%2Bstila%2Btropic%2Bgarnier%2Bordinary%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Btoo%2Bfaced%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.millerharris.com/collections/bath-body" target="_blank"&gt;Miller Harris Rose Silence Body Wash&lt;/a&gt; (£24.00)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been waiting such a long time for Miller Harris to branch into bath and body care - and thankfully it was worth the wait. I adore their Rose Silence scent (I got through half a bottle within a matter of weeks when I first discovered it,) so I'm thrilled I can now douse myself in it during every morning shower. The packaging is simple, as you'd expect, but within is a beautifully scented wash that will just enhance the effect of the scent and provide a luxurious moment. Yes it's a lot of money for a body wash, but if we can't treat ourselves to a little pampering then what's the point in anything? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thefragranceshop.co.uk/dkny-donald-roberton-collection.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;DKNY Be Delicious 'City Girls' Fragrance&lt;/a&gt; (£38.50) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been more versions of Be Delicious than I could possibly count, but this time it's the turn of illustrator Donald Robertson to create something a little different. Available in three variants, this blue 'Brooklyn Girl' number is definitely my fave; a little edgier and not as sweet as the others, it's undoubtedly something you could spritz all over day after day. You'll either love or hate the rather unusual and artsy designs, but don't let that put you off what's inside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R1lloDUbk0E/WKcWacFJatI/AAAAAAAAirE/phkganGSracRFj160c84tYNR1-mBy-KQACEw/s1600/New%2BIn%2BThsi%2BWeek%2Baveeno%2Bmillerharris%2Bstila%2Btropic%2Bgarnier%2Bordinary%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Btoo%2Bfaced%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kFimVx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stila Magnificent Metals Glitter &amp;amp; Glow Liquid Eyeshadows&lt;/a&gt; (£23.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;It's been so long since I really used any Stila cosmetics (I remember they used to be the coolest brand when I first started blogging, but they've taken a bit of a hit over the years) but these liquid glitter eyeshadows are AH-MAZIN. They're incredibly pigmented and packed full of glitter, providing a really sophsiticated and slightly rocky look that's even more sexy when blended into a smokey eye. Choose from either a black or golden glitter, but both can take you from day to night with ease - I adore them. Part of a limited edition collection, if you like the sound of the result you're gonna have to act fast and snap them up before they're gone.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-axDi1_p0dXk/WKcMzWkwfiI/AAAAAAAAiqc/p4IErhHRPu4z1BOxBBaDkY9TAWaYXvdyACEw/s1600/New%2BIn%2BThsi%2BWeek%2Baveeno%2Bmillerharris%2Bstila%2Btropic%2Bgarnier%2Bordinary%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Btoo%2Bfaced%2B5.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-high-spreadability-fluid-primer-30ml" target="_blank"&gt;The Ordinary High Silicone/Spreadibility Liquid Primer&lt;/a&gt; (£5.50)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the brands I was most excited for in 2016, The Ordinary have just launched into Fenwicks and rumour has it they'll be appearing on many more high streets this year - as well as in the very first Deciem stand alone store. These two primers are seriously cheap but still seriously effective; of the two I prefer the traditional silicone primer which creates an effortless smooth finish on skin, but if you prefer your bases light and airy then the liquid primer is a great alternative. Either way, they're great primers to have in your reportoire (whether you use one every day or not.)&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i1BEUhBqSes/WKcO-1nZMlI/AAAAAAAAiqo/eIqrFEj5km4dOADFegF7r3CR-rICvBaAgCEw/s1600/New%2BIn%2BThsi%2BWeek%2Baveeno%2Bmillerharris%2Bstila%2Btropic%2Bgarnier%2Bordinary%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Btoo%2Bfaced%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lqqEV9" target="_blank"&gt;Too Faced Sweet Peach Creamy Oil Lipglosses&lt;/a&gt; (£16.00)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I've got a problem. I can't stop smelling these delicious little tubes of peachy goodness. Just the right side of sweet and addictive, these creamy glosses are enriched with nourishing oils to provide a comfortable yet pigmented finish; available in three shades, these are perfect for transitioning into spring. My fave is the peachy pink colour, as it adds just a hint of femininity to my look without me having to go full throttle with the cerise, but the bright oranges will be just the ticket come summer. As soon as you pop open the cap you breathe in the scent, so you may become a little too obsessed with re-applying than you should be.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0NafIiEKX5k/WKcM_dhh07I/AAAAAAAAiqc/LPGv9DHu9502_urgDMSuCq0ZI5msE86pwCEw/s1600/new%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lqsd5x" target="_blank"&gt;Kiehls Pure Vitality Skin Renewing Cream&lt;/a&gt; (£43.00)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formulated with Red Ginseng Root and Manuka Honey, this claims to be able to help strengthen your skin's barrier and encourage skin renewal - the result of which should be smoother, healthier looking and more resiilent skin. Although I've only tried it once to date, it is a pleasure to apply and actually smells a little of honey; it's relatively lightweight but instantly nourishes, leaving skin feeling plump and hydrated. Sometimes you just need the most basic of moisturiser to do the job, but if you want to skip all the other steps in your regime an enriched and hardworking product like this is always a great idea. I'll report back in a few weeks when I've used it more thoroughly!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WWmuVDMt3lA/WKcM3qHd8uI/AAAAAAAAiqc/zwRWEWGH2EQ8OnQwuLhQdp0oRBYoekwYgCEw/s1600/New%2BIn%2BThsi%2BWeek%2Baveeno%2Bmillerharris%2Bstila%2Btropic%2Bgarnier%2Bordinary%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Btoo%2Bfaced%2B7.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kF7TJB" target="_blank"&gt;Jo Malone 50ml Velvet &amp;amp; Rose Oud Fragrance&lt;/a&gt; (£74.00)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I think I've found my favourite Jo Malone scent, another one comes along to take its place within my perfume hierarchy. This is a deliciously romantic and rich scent that's perfect for this time of year - when you want to wear something a little fresher and more floral, but don't want to leave behind the deeper smokey notes of winter just yet. Although this is a beautiful fragrance, the news is actually that Jo Malone are now offering their 'Intense' fragrances in 50ml bottles (which does make them a touch more affordable.) They're cute in size, practical in nature and kinder on the purse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6Fg0r9694_U/WKcVZoho6rI/AAAAAAAAiq8/CcsxLHbVi1wWk1yUhg8NA_1u3iYEBse-QCLcB/s1600/New%2BIn%2BThsi%2BWeek%2Baveeno%2Bmillerharris%2Bstila%2Btropic%2Bgarnier%2Bordinary%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Btoo%2Bfaced%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/garnier-skinactive-micellar-cleansing-gel-wash-combination-and-sensitive-skin-200ml-10226320" target="_blank"&gt;Garnier Micellar Cleansing Gel Wash&lt;/a&gt; (£3.99)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micellar waters are nothing new (I got bored of them a long time ago,) but this cleansing gel wash embraces the same technology to gently help rid the skin of dirt and grime. Although it's never going to offer the same benefits as a thorough cleanse, this is a great little tool to have in your shower for a morning wash - or even to leave by the sink as a second cleanse. It doesn't strip skin or leave it feeling tight, but just helps to thoroughly remove traces of makeup and grime that have been left behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tropicskincare.com/good-skin-day-serum.html" target="_blank"&gt;Tropic Skincare Good Skin Day Resurfacing Serum&lt;/a&gt; (£42.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet as candy, this little bottle contains a lot of goodness to help restore skin's radiance - either as a day serum that can be worn under makeup, or an overnight treatment. The formula includes lime pearl extract, glycolic acids and willow bark BHA exfoliate for a smoother skin surface, papaya enzymes and AHA fruit complexes to refine and tighten pores, plus a concentrated formula of hyaluronic acid to deliver a boost of skin hydration. Used daily, it will help to slough away the dull surface of skin and leave a radiant and smoother finish behind instead; formulated with tonnes of naturally sourced ingredients, this has definitely left my skin looking and feeling brighter already. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/aveeno-daily-moisturising-after-shower-mist-10222896" target="_blank"&gt;Aveeno After-Shower Mist&lt;/a&gt; (£7.50)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm all about the spray body lotions nowadays, as they help to moisturise my skin without leaving it feeling clammy. I can't be dealing with sticky tights or hanging around waiting for creams to fully absorb - this girls got sh*t to be getting on with. This super lightweight version from Aveeno has been specially formulated to be used just after you step out of the shower, helping to lock in moisture and replenish any that's been lost during your morning scrub. Although it's actually really just a good marketing story (you can use this any time, you little rebel!) the product is like a very nourishing water spray; it's transparent in colour and absorbs incredibly quickly, even mixing with those last droplets of water on your skin to leave a smooth and comfortable surface. I like it a lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K1XjG65OsyE/WKcNELL_TuI/AAAAAAAAiqc/iVrvNqwG_gYUP09CI2wQ4mpFZrw8BZUMgCEw/s1600/new%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you got your eye on any of my ten current faves?

The original was released back in 1991 when I was barely nine years old, but I can still remember the songs practically word-for-world and continue to dream of having a dress as beautiful (and yellow) as Belle's in that classic scene; there's something about the emotion that's attached to such a tale that still puts a smile on my face. Skip forward over 25 years and this iconic story is about to get a new lease of live via the live action version, starring our very own Hermoine Granger. (My inner Potter-nerd is probably happier about that than it should be.) It's not even due to hit cinemas for another month, but the merchandise has already started to go into overdrive to tickle our tastebuds and get us in the mood for the big event. Although I may be too old for plastic dolls and princess dresses, I'm definitely not past the stage of wanting a piece of Beauty and the Beast lipstick - so when I discovered that L'Oreal were launching a 14-piece collection to celebrate the launch, I almost peed myself with excitement. The only downside is that it's exclusively available in Italy, but thanks to an Amazon Prime account I was able to buy it and ship the collection over in a couple of days! Hoorah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H6WKYDItiSc/WKRvx6-X42I/AAAAAAAAio4/wNevObPC0SktFY4Qq-2UDhy6OdGJy28GwCLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First things first: the collection includes seven lipsticks and seven coordinating nail polishes, which together set me back around £90.00. That works out about £6.40 each, with the bonus that they're all packed in a special edition keepsake box; they're not cheap, but together it's not insanely expensive if you're obsessed with the film franchise or just simply want a piece of makeup history. Each of the main characters each have their own lipstick and polish (including Belle, Beast, Mrs Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere, the featherduster and the rose) which are adorned with designs that correspond to their character. Unfortunately the designs aren't printed onto the packaging itself, but instead are stickers that have been applied over the top; I can only assume that this is why the range hasn't been brought over to the UK, as it's not the same standard we're used to seeing from L'Oreal (even if the stickers are good quality and textured, as well as featuring embossed metallic touches.) Nevertheless, the overall effect is somewhat magical and definitely makes me feel like this is something to be treasured for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZiuxhYHgJaY/WKRtx7CWasI/AAAAAAAAiok/i2u9ZyExzSgqyvXggo68AsouNCJ_3PTDQCLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B17.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0F7kJM5keb0/WKRsJtmJyAI/AAAAAAAAioA/uYgWA2_3Fc8WPBU5cPMan9oO7pjbM_wOgCLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B12.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cRy-yD_GfXI/WKRsMoB_TNI/AAAAAAAAioE/1wnCnurxqbs_2ScipetPVF-cS8y6kpcZQCLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B13.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collection includes a number of bold shades, including a classic red and power pink, alongside a more wearable chocolate brown and nude tone. I would've liked to see more of a spectrum (there feels like there's a lot of red, perhaps because of the Italian market?) but they're all very wearable and universal in appeal - just like the nail polishes. (That navy blue!) Personally I don't get why the Cogsworth products aren't a beautiful brown colour, nor why there's a very random featherduster (not a main character in my opinion) and slightly tacky lipstick mark design, but the rest of the range definitely leaves me feeling pleased with my purchase. Thankfully the box everything is held in absolutely met my expectations, providing a covetable and great quality outer in which to store the makeup items within (because you know these aren't meant to be actually used!) I do wish that there were token limited edition Beauty and the Beast lipsticks and polishes available in the UK, especially because the rose version is so pretty, but alas... Maybe the fact you can't get hold of them makes it all the more lustworthy? I'm definitely in the mood for a Be Our Guest marathon now, even if I can't bring myself to actually apply the polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UtXVKpvYtA0/WKRsQTPImHI/AAAAAAAAioI/a5Ya01IuMUsK8vE-hhKGxyVEogK5WUJEQCLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B14.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_tIo4Bbj1bw/WKRtw6IsbPI/AAAAAAAAiog/jcFy8UQF9yQ6N5Km4XY5b6Og1ew7lgt5ACLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B16.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VRaJ-enSGts/WKRsTHaH9LI/AAAAAAAAioM/JZKaptigAfI2MSEvqFDdnPwYIIdreg1lACLcB/s1600/Tale%2BAs%2BOld%2BAs%2BTime%2BJust%2BLook%2BAt%2BThe%2BL%2527Oreal%2BBeauty%2B%2526%2BThe%2BBeast%2BMakeup%2BCollection%2521%2B15.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think of this limited edition collection?

There are so many beauty rules and regulations set by the media (including us bloggers!) but realistically none of us will ever be able to follow them to the letter - be it time, energy, understanding or finances preventing us from doing so. Although there are certain things I would recommend either avoiding or adopting, there's also a tonne of stuff that's really not worth getting in a flap over; you're not going to ruin your body if you skip a step, forget to take off your makeup effectively or use a touch of sulphate-enriched shampoo on your head, but it is important to be aware and informed so you can choose what's right for you. Here are the eight 'mistakes' many of us make, and why you shouldn't get in a flap over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4DwFz0m922s/WKRE00c7feI/AAAAAAAAinM/97TfK1houJsvY7KtH70tMG8eohPUZGFOgCLcB/s1600/Don%2527t%2BWorry%2BAbout%2BIt%2B8%2BBeauty%2B%2527Mistakes%2527%2BYou%2BShouldn%2527t%2BBe%2BGetting%2BIn%2BA%2BFlap%2BOver%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. SKIPPING SERUM AND/OR EYE CREAM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Don't get me wrong, I love a complicated skincare regime as much as the next beauty obsessive, but sometimes it's ok to skip that extra step. I understand that adding four layers beneath your makeup can cause more problems than it helps if you don't get it right (the key is to only apply a touch and not coat your face in a light layer of goo,) so if you feel like serum or eye cream isn't for you then that's cool. Just make sure you have a regime that works for your needs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. REACHING FOR A FACE WIPE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Yep, still hate them, but face wipes do serve a purpose: to help remove the superficial layer of dirt we see in the mirror after a long night out/the day that felt like it was never going to end. Although they will only ever remove the top layer of makeup and offer nothing in the way of a deep cleanse, something is better than nothing. Just don't make it a regular occurrence as the alcohol can dry out skin, while the remaining grime on your face will inevitably cause breakouts.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. NOT DOUBLE CLEANSING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Us bloggers have got a tendency to preach about double cleansing, when in actual fact it's not right for everybody. If you wear heavy makeup and/or SPF you should definitely be cleansing twice in the evening to ensure your complexion is squeaky clean, but if you suffer with dryness or irritation, wear only a little or no makeup, or simply have a tendency to over scrub, then a singular cleanse may be all you need. If you're prone to breakouts, acne or rosacea, then definitely stick to a gentle single cleanse.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. TURNING UP YOUR STRAIGHTENERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;I come from the generation of women who had to turn their straighteners up to full wack to get them to do anything; but that was before GHDs and scorching temperatures that could practically sever a finger. I'm sure we're all guilty of using our appliances on the hottest setting, but the most important thing is you apply a heat protection spray so you don't burn off your tresses - and that you regularly embrace putting down the tools. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. USING TOO MUCH DRY SHAMPOO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Dry shampoos are designed to draw out moisture from the hair and scalp, removing the 'lank' feeling that can often occur between washes; however, when overused they can actually remove too much moisture. (&lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/2015/08/the-truth-about-dry-shampoo-could-it-be.html" target="_blank"&gt;Find out more here&lt;/a&gt;) Despite that, dry shampoo is one of the biggest must-haves and is used so often that we can't really remember a time without it. Rather than ditching it or feeling guilty, opt for a lighter and more natural version that won't clog the hair follicles - your head will be happy, plus you can get those extra minutes in bed. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. FORGETTING A BASE COAT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;One of my biggest beauty hates is that inevitable staining when you've removed your dark nail polish; what is is about deep reds that leave a mark on your fingers for days to come? We're told we should always use a base coat in order to provide protection and help to strengthen the nail, but in my experience it really doesn't make that much difference - especially now many polishes are enriched with ingredients that are supposed to offer a base coat effect anyway. Take my advice and skip this extra step in favour of applying a top coat; at least that may help with longevity!&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. DYING YOUR WHOLE HEAD (NOT JUST THE ROOTS)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Every single time I open a new box of hair dye, I whimper at the thought of having to apply it in a two-phased approach; it doubles the time and effort, when all I want to do is chuck it on and get rid of those greys. Although it is better for your hair to apply to the roots for the majority of the time, topping up the rest of your locks in the last few minutes, realistically you won't overly damage your barnet by chucking on more dye - especially when most of the time it's already saturated with the same colour. If your priority is those annoying greys, get on with it and then get on with your life. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. NOT CARING ABOUT INGREDIENTS&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;There's so much information online about parabens, silicones, sulphates and so on - and even more so about opting for organic or embracing the natural. Although I'm a firm believer in being informed and making purchasing decisions that work for you, you're not going to die from a bottle of shampoo. (If you think you are, please stop reading the Daily Mail.) If you care passionately about what you put on and in your body, that's great - but equally if you really couldn't give a toss that's absolutely fine too. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Do you worry about any of these beauty 'mistakes' creeping into your daily life? Are you fed up of being made to feel like a rubbish woman because you don't use seven products on your face every morning, or because you go through a bottle of dry shampoo a fortnight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-epwiTNYC82A/WKRE1xFw0TI/AAAAAAAAinQ/MryexVpvr-M-niLzdXNc3rDUEap_AEEAQCEw/s1600/Don%2527t%2BWorry%2BAbout%2BIt%2B8%2BBeauty%2B%2527Mistakes%2527%2BYou%2BShouldn%2527t%2BBe%2BGetting%2BIn%2BA%2BFlap%2BOver%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

(Nothing against Wallis, just a metaphorical signal of getting old and not fitting in Zara any more!) For the past couple of months I've been living in jeans and jumpers on rotation, which gets a bit boring after a while - especially when I only seem to buy jumpers in cream, grey or black. I've definitely been trying to spice up my wardrobe with a few pieces that make a statement, or rediscover old favourites that I'd forgotten how much I loved; the weather is so changeable right now, meaning I'm never wearing the right thing, but embracing colour and texture is a great way of having fun with your outfits without jumping into spring fashion a month too early. That's what I did during an overnight stay at The Rosewood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-swvMEbmFNNE/WKL4m0XQsdI/AAAAAAAAimQ/UWM9ZsbcXP4BO8_oLRDGcdf7vRL9EP2DACLcB/s1600/OOTD.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SKIRT&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;I've been loving the stretchy Topshop midi-length skirts for some time  now, having picked up my first nearly a year ago to transition into  spring; they're effortless, but still make me feel like I'm making more  of an effort than I do when chucking on jeans, and the stretchy material  actually means I can fit into them. Hoorah! I've got one in mustard,  nude and a very pale blue, but when I spotted one in metallic gold I  practically ran to the till and chucked them my money - why is a  metallic skirt so hot right now? I've worn this a few times with a  velvet tee or strappy slip during the evening, but I decided to bite the  bullet and fashion it for daytime with a rather loud and proud jumper  too. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2leMU4j" target="_blank"&gt;SEE THE SKIRT HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE JUMPER&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;I adore the colour combo of this jumper - and so does practically everyone I come into contact with when wearing it. Believe it or not, it's from New Look and is currently in the sale for only £7.00 (down from the £22.99 I paid; blooming typical.) It's super comfy and slightly cropped, making it perfect for pairing with a skirt or high waisted trousers if you don't want to get your belly out every time you stretch. I like the fact it's not heavy or overly thick, ensuring it's a great transitional piece for when you know it's a bit chilly but you'll probably be sweating by lunchtime. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2leCFNg" target="_blank"&gt;SEE THE JUMPER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XEvpKWpBdX0/WKLTK6-2jnI/AAAAAAAAil8/QooaJdnLegI7s4qXkO2zQpo8VcF549lPwCEw/s1600/OOTD%2BMetallic%252C%2BStripes%2B%2526%2BGoogly%2BEyes%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ede6FAwH4XQ/WKLS8q-QMPI/AAAAAAAAil0/ISD7DEQ0iXo1xC9tzMBm4C4RpHx7Om27wCEw/s1600/OOTD%2BMetallic%252C%2BStripes%2B%2526%2BGoogly%2BEyes%2B%2B10.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MM5ldUDzW50/WKLTRT425iI/AAAAAAAAil8/AM6ylAQYvt4Mp-RlSFqyUKE6v9mkW6AewCEw/s1600/OOTD%2BMetallic%252C%2BStripes%2B%2526%2BGoogly%2BEyes%2B%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C0z-KEqpTNk/WKLTh6EddSI/AAAAAAAAil8/_1CZlwZ2PUcUolAndmWLhocZGmlQQzKGgCEw/s1600/OOTD%2BMetallic%252C%2BStripes%2B%2526%2BGoogly%2BEyes%2B11.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V1ZCAQQi0Bc/WKLS-pNdhvI/AAAAAAAAil0/FvErfGrgu54_YH0MULlWgovbiD4ipAtVQCEw/s1600/OOTD%2BMetallic%252C%2BStripes%2B%2526%2BGoogly%2BEyes%2B%2B13.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SHOES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of boots already. I have so many pairs and at the end of every season I feel like I should've given them more outings than I did, but right now I have an unnatural urge to let my toes free and embrace slip-ons instead. These dark green velvet loafers are from Zara and definitely add a touch more colour and texture to my look, without prohibiting my ability to walk in a straight line; when I'm in London comfort takes priority. I picked them up last Autumn so you'll be lucky to find them anywhere, but there are a tonne of similar ones available to help you transfer from boot back to shoe. The only issue is that they attract ALL the dust and you can never get them looking pristine again from the moment you walk outside. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lFrUVm" target="_blank"&gt;SEE SIMILAR SHOES HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE BAG&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;What brings an outfit all together? A rather cute, quirky and fun bag! I've been lusting after this Anya Hindmarsh cross-body bag for blooming ages, but it's over £800 full retail price (ouch) so I couldn't justify that much simply because it was cute. Cue an impromptu visit to Biscester Village with my fiancé (first time I've written that - weird!) and I found this in the AH boutique for 50% off. WHOOP! I love everything about it: the super soft leather, the heavy chain strap, the little pouch on the reverse and the fact that it's big enough for everything I need (including my camera) for a day out. The googly eyes are just a bonus as it gives an otherwise standard bag a little twist that just lifts any outfit; the cream colour is totally tran-seasonal and the shape classic, so even though it's a piece from a seasonal limited edition collection I know it will age well. A worthy investment (and you can get them in other colours for a similar price online now too.) I've used it so many times already. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2lFvuyy" target="_blank"&gt;SEE THE BAG HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An easy to wear, super comfy and practical outfit with just a sprinkling of edge.

Adding a powerful pout to an otherwise low key outfit can perk you up and help you to look 'finished', while a glide of an understated nude shade just helps to convey that feeling of effortless elegance. However, there is a downside to wearing a touch of lippie: my lips tend to become dry, uncomfortable and unable to take more than a second layer of colour. Last week I wore a fabulous Kat Von D number in a statement red shade, but after a few hours the colour had bled and my lips were feeling dryer than the dessert during a heatwave; what looks great when you step out the door doesn't always keep feeling fab when you just want to go about your business. Burt's Bees have always been a brand I've had a lot of love for (and probably the brand I'm most loyal to, simply because their lipbalms are in every pocket, drawer and handbag in my life) because their formulations are full of goodness while ensuring such a comfortable finish. They've dabbled in colour before with the launch of their lip crayons (&lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/2016/05/youll-eat-1000-lipsticks-in-your.html" target="_blank"&gt;which I loved and wrote about here&lt;/a&gt;,) but this springtime they're taking that one step further with the launch of full on &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kZ9f3M" target="_blank"&gt;lipsticks&lt;/a&gt; in 18 covetable shades - all of which provide fabulous pigment and a super comfortable finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--xrLOuI5iq0/WKGufhEoikI/AAAAAAAAikE/IrJdwfe2BkILCwQOooA0IFoETgqx3X-AACEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B%2B5.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Housed in cute bee-inspired packaging, these bullets provide full coverage and vibrant colour with up to eight hours of colour (although I'd like to find anyone that's able to make their lipsticks last for eight hours - maybe they don't talk or eat for a full day?!) Like the rest of the Burt's Bees range, these are 100% natural (but not organic) and are bursting with tasty ingredients including beeswax, Vitamin E, Moringa and Raspberry Seed Oils to help condition your lips all day long. What you will notice when you apply these is that they feel like a beautiful nourishing balm, not a drying lipstick; they glide over lips with ease to deposit a beautiful colour result in shades that range from the perfect pink and nudes, to the bold berry tones and classic reds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that with the darker and more statement shades it's worth buffing your lips throroughly to remove any dry skin, as for some reason the formula can clump around dry patches and look a bit inconsistent; similarly, it's worth applying the darker tones with a lip brush rather than straight from the bullet, as they can appear a bit patchy. Although the packaging for me does cheapen the overall look and feel of the lipsticks, it is made of 100% recycled plastic and can be recycled after use too... So I suppose that outweighs the need for something super premium and aesthetically pleasing. It still does the job, and I love the little coloured honeycomb holes, but I would have liked just a touch more material to make it feel a bit sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For £9.99 they're a great little buy and one I know I'll be reaching for a lot when I want my colour to last without getting the fear that re-applying will dry out my lips for days. Well done Burt, you've created another great addition to your ever expanding lip portfolio! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o6KJM1ztefg/WKGuW6NoPsI/AAAAAAAAikE/vS4a3s0-9_oHI4O7GjSjRgxfkm90_vPcQCEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I4BONV5pH-M/WKGu9r2vWnI/AAAAAAAAikM/IEK6P-uEOgg29ZT1FKRpS-cxWSlSicjjgCEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nhX3fc3vhmc/WKGubyTsawI/AAAAAAAAikE/IWjz5VgkAWENEjZA43nGtMcIbF6WEuy_ACEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B%2B8.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qQEFNFeCxkY/WKGwGv1dvvI/AAAAAAAAikQ/tFhP55xVhSoj_zmvpklAqRfrlTBvrLLVgCEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kgp_ESTDUqc/WKGwG8vblzI/AAAAAAAAikg/Em_cuaPQHF0XNOfZWlflqGb0nyLrRcn7ACEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B%2B9.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cMdJcK5vojc/WKGw1srJDgI/AAAAAAAAikc/BNZU9g2uwjg__BsI9_ecpkDGigI69g2bgCEw/s1600/Supercharged%2BHigh%2BPigment%2BLip%2BColours%2BThat%2BAre%2BOH-SO%2BCOMFY%2BBurt%2527s%2BBees%2BNEW%2BLipsticks%2B10.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.burtsbees.co.uk/natural-products/lips-lip-colour/lipstick.html" target="_blank"&gt;Burt's Bees lipsticks&lt;/a&gt; are available now in 18 shades, priced £9.99 each.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

I love everything about traveling (from the pre-trip prep and airport shopping experience, to sitting on the plane with a guidebook organising what you're going to do in the coming days,) and I've definitely got the bug right now; my list of places to visit just keeps on getting longer, not helped by the number of travel blogs I keep discovering and salivating over. There's so much more to the world than the Costa Del Sol and New York City, and I want a part of it. I'm fortunate enough to have the time, finances and flexibility to travel much more in my thirties than I ever have before, so I'm making a concerted effort to see the world and discover as many amazing places as I can get through - starting with these five that I'm just itching to fly off to.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZweKuDnmUME/WKctoi6gVlI/AAAAAAAAirk/GBQHrQxyOTwLpJ91Vb2RNBcjQaaUydSQgCLcB/s1600/Wanderlusting%2BMy%2BDream%2BTravel%2BDestinations%2B2017.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;GIRAFFE MANOR, NAIROBI &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I've always wanted to visit the beautiful African lands (maybe I've watched The Lion King too many times) and discover my inner jungle princess, but since discovering &lt;a href="http://nairobi/" target="_blank"&gt;Giraffe Manor&lt;/a&gt; that passion has trebled. This incredible 1930's style manor house hotel is set within a vast Nairobi landscape and oozes vintage appeal; not only are the surroundings utterly stunning, but you can actually feed the giraffes while you eat your breakfast as they pop their heads through the window for a morning snack. How amazing is that? It costs a small fortune, but I'm determined to get here at some point in the not too distant future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;POMPEII, ITALY&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My fascination with this historic town dates back to studying it at school and seeing the incredible figures in their frozen positions; I've watched documentary after documentary on the days leading up to the event that's forever etched in history and can't quite get my head around what it must have been like. My mum visited Pompeii a couple of years ago and was hypnotised by its story, so after seeing her pictures I've been itching to go myself. Italy is such a beautiful country, but there's something special about this location that I simply must tick off my list.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ST TROPEZ, SOUTH OF FRANCE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was lucky enough to stay in St Tropez for a night a couple of years ago on a press trip (the yaughts are insane!) but 24 hours just wasn't enough to take it all in. Although the main attraction is the harbor, there are so many little back streets and cafes to discover that make this more than an overnight destination. I'd love to charter a boat for a few days and sail around the coast (wishful thinking,) but in the meantime a hotel in the area and a seat on the edge of the port with a nice glass of rose wine will suffice.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;COPENHAGEN, DENMARK&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The home of all things Hygge, Copenhagen has a relaxed and cosy appeal like no other city. Full of design and style inspiration, it's Instagram heaven for anyone that can appreciate the clean lines and muted colour palette - while the watery backdrop allows you to breathe in and appreciate the surroundings. Steeped in history as much as art and modern culture, this is a city I know will be super expensive but absolutely worth it. I can't wait to find an Airbnb to ensure I get the local experience too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MIAMI, FLORIDA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When we had our Florida holiday about 18 months ago we were planning to drive down to Miami and spend a day on the beach - but time got away from us and we realised we needed some down time after the intensity of the parks. (Miami is about a four hour drive from central Florida, so that's a long way to go for a day trip.) Since then I've wondered about organising a visit back to take in the pastel architecture and incredible beaches, and right now it seems like a better idea than ever. I've heard such great things about this part of the world, and its association with Dexter just makes it even more of a destination. (Just me?!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where would you love to visit in 2017? Are you dreaming of any of my ultimate destinations too? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Are We Over Cheaper Copies Of Firm Favourites? </title><content type='html'>&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;For the best part of the past five years, we've been collectively obsessed with the dupe. Us beauty bloggers have undoubtedly been fueling the trend, promising readers that the latest eyeshadow palette to land on our doorstep is a brilliant copy of something four times the price, but the market has also been driven by technological improvements that allow us to buy into the same quality for a fraction of the previous cost. When I was growing up the only 'budget' beauty brands were Collection 2000 and Boots 17, both offering a plethora of products to get experimental with but the quality wasn't there; as soon as we could upgrade to something a touch more glamorous, we would. Skip forward a few decades and those (rebranded) names are not only offering far superior quality and in some instances competing with some of the most luxury cosmetics available, but our high streets have been somewhat revolutionised. Names including MUA, Makeup Revolution, Lottie London, NYX, Freedom, GOSH, Miss Sporty, Model's Own and Sleek are proving that you don't have to spend a fortune to fill your makeup bag with greatness - but they're also collectively providing us with dupes of everything from Urban Decay Naked palettes and Kylie liquid lipsticks, to NARS blushers and Bobbi Brown highlighters. For a moment there we got a bit excited, but are we over it? Is 2017 the year that we're finally bored of the dupe and we start trading up for something we can treasure? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc1ntGb8TEs/WJniMNVmygI/AAAAAAAAiiI/ZTV7Mxl_IvwWJdRPJ5QdzOWIV66mBDprgCLcB/s1600/Is%2BThe%2BDupe%2B%2526%2BCopycat%2BBeauty%2BMarket%2BWaning%2BAre%2BWe%2BOver%2BCheaper%2BCopies%2BOf%2BFirm%2BFavourites%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In my opinion the growth of our dupe fascination came with the rise in popularity of throwaway fashion and being able to snap up something on-trend for the price of your morning coffee. Primark allowed us to update last year's jumper with the help of a £2.50 statement necklace, or pick up a pair of pumps for £4.00 during our lunchbreak; we became obsessed with buying all the fashion and always having something new to adorn our bodies with, as for the first time ever fashion became insanely affordable. It became the norm to buy a new outfit for every night out, because we didn't have to break our backs to do so; it became pretty standardised to pick up a Mulberry or Chloe copy from New Look or Topshop as the high street tried to capture our attention in new and exciting ways. Unsurprisingly this filtered pretty quickly into the beauty industry, with consumers always wanting to hunt down that must-have product without having to fork out the full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some brands have built their entire business models off the back of dupes, even taking the time to ensure their packaging is 'inspired' by their more expensive counterparts. Makeup Revolution, Barry M, Sleek, W7 and The Balm are some of the worst (or best) culprits, being able to turn around a new product and offer up a dupe sometimes within a few months of the original hitting shelves. Others take a softer approach, preferring to identify trends (nude eyeshadow palettes, liquid lipsticks and finely milled pigmented blushers) and create their own take without stepping on any toes. Up until this point they've benefited from a huge surge in consumer interest (fueled by bloggers knowing that anything considered a dupe will bring in those much needed hits!) but my gut feeling is that this is coming to an end. Although picking up a cut price item of makeup will give us a buzz, if it just doesn't perform or feel like the original would we be better off saving our pennies and splurging on products we know we'll thoroughly enjoy from beginning to end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love brands like Makeup Revolution, but I can't help but feel like they need to step out of the dupe arena and create something new. Endless tweaks on the same product get a little dull, while a stand full of copycats makes me feel like they lack the creativity consumers are beginning to expect. Just as I've moved away from fast fashion, I'm also moving away from fast beauty; I would far prefer to spend £20.00 on something I know produces the results I need than impulsively chuck a few pounds on something ten times over that never gets used. Although the quality of affordable makeup is so much better than it ever has been, I do feel that as a society we're moving towards more considered purchasing and are starting to make wise investments less often - rather than feeling the need to snap up anything and everything because it's cheap.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I adore affordable beauty and I know you do too; I know you love to find out what's exciting and what bargain buys are worth snapping up, but it's all about balance. I know you also  want to know what's worth spending your money on and making informed decisions about those purchases. Although I don't think these affordable brands are going anywhere, I do feel that this year there will be a move away from creating copies and dupes - towards real innovation that stands on its own two feet. Brands including Kiko, NYX and Bourjois are creating covetable pieces (at affordable prices) without feeling the need to copy or imitate, to the point where they're sure to become cult classics themselves; with the technological advances and birth of the internet allowing practically anyone to set up shop and ship worldwide, there's no excuse to remain stagnant or just copy what everyone else is doing. Us consumers demand more, but brands are you listening? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think about dupes and copycat brands? Do you love them and can't get enough, or are you moving towards more considered investment purchases? Or are you just torn? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJKZLs_5mMQ/WJnioJAGXDI/AAAAAAAAiiQ/S9OCy6luI9A5faipSoUf5ex67cWCFK8bgCLcB/s1600/Is%2BThe%2BDupe%2B%2526%2BCopycat%2BBeauty%2BMarket%2BWaning%2BAre%2BWe%2BOver%2BCheaper%2BCopies%2BOf%2BFirm%2BFavourites%2B5.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z0Oqic1Zs50/WJnhZCdpK3I/AAAAAAAAih8/iysOoMBSjC8T42a39Mq-iazJq39tTGcowCLcB/s1600/Is%2BThe%2BDupe%2B%2526%2BCopycat%2BBeauty%2BMarket%2BWaning%2BAre%2BWe%2BOver%2BCheaper%2BCopies%2BOf%2BFirm%2BFavourites%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

There's such an (incorrect) assumption that blogging is a young girls game, when in actual fact digital platforms provide a democratic platform for those of all ages, genders, interests and locations to share their passions and opinions. Right now there's a revolution happening in the bloggersphere, where women aged thirty and over are growing in number while proving the incredible value they can offer to both reader and brand - and I'm incredibly proud to be part of it. About 18 months ago I started to make a concerted effort to connect with other bloggers that were also feeling a bit out of the loop and almost 'too old' for this digital game, but quickly it became clear that we were collectively smashing it out of the park and proving that blogging really isn't just for the teens. As a result, my blogging collective &lt;a href="http://wearethirtyplus.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Thirty Plus&lt;/a&gt; was born and we now have over 700 amazing sites proving how much great content is out there for those in their 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond. (Shameless plug there: if you're not a member already and want to be part of something awesome, find out more and sign up via the &lt;a href="http://wearethirtyplus.com/" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.) As we hit our stride and start to plan some incredible collaborations with brands this year, it got me thinking about why I'm so excited and proud to be a 30+ blogger - and why we're not going anywhere but up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1vZdf9ZHT48/WJhByvD7vII/AAAAAAAAihQ/GTZSnja29Xc6DJYTIC8luMfE45UFv9LdACLcB/s1600/Why%2BI%2527m%2BProud%2BTo%2BBe%2BA%2B30%252B%2BBlogger%2B.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'M PROUD TO KNOW WHO I AM &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Too many bloggers are apologetic or afraid of standing out. Too many cookie cutter influencers are copying one another because they each think the other has the secret to success, when the actual secret is all in being unique. I've been blogging for nearly seven years and during that time I've evolved as a woman, but also as a content creator; I'm not afraid to be exactly who I am, share my opinions and put myself out there as an imperfect specimen of Twenty-First-Century-Life. Although I wish I lived in an all-white apartment and had a perfect figure, I know that I'm more than that - and I'm proud of it. I'm a 34 year old who is passionate about politics, self-acceptance and emotional wellbeing; I care about making positive change, I'm not afraid of calling people out when I think they're acting unethically and I can deal with the fall-out when it undoubtedly comes. It's all water off a ducks back to me, which makes me even more passionate about sharing my thoughts and opinions. There's no dumbing down or avoiding hot topics on here! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MY EXPERIENCES ARE WELL ROUNDED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This time ten years ago I can tell you that I was self-absorbed, self-critical and had very little perspective on the world around me. Experiences provide you with benchmarks from which to base opinions and actions, as well as proving that you're not the centre of the universe; not everything is about you personally and a different opinion doesn't mean that you're unlikeable - debate is healthy and should be actively encouraged. Experience comes with age and experiences are the lifeblood of any digital space - without them it quickly becomes a very dry and one dimensional space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I KNOW A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Generally speaking, the longer you've lived the more you pick up from experience. As a result I know a lot about the beauty industry, how it works behind the scenes, what ingredients are must-haves, the trends that are around the corner, which new launches are actually just re-hashes from ten years ago and what is actually genuine innovation. Over the last thirteen years I've worked on a multitude of brands and been responsible for everything from in-store marketing and television campaigns, to social strategy and digital media; this exposure gives me a great perspective and allows me to share that with you guys to in turn help you increase your knowledge and understanding. In my opinion that's far more valuable insight than a nineteen year old saying "ooooh pretty" at everything that lands on their doorstep - and why I religiously read blogs such as &lt;a href="http://britishbeautyblogger.com/" target="_blank"&gt;British Beauty Blogger&lt;/a&gt;. (Her knowledge of the industry is insane.) &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WE NEED TO SEE MORE DIVERSITY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I for one am increasingly bored of seeing the same bloggers time and time and again being held up as the ultimate in digital creators. They're always twenty-something, white, middle class, beautiful and carrying a designer handbag - but the beauty of the bloggersphere is that we come in all shapes, sizes, colours and ages. Some of my fave blogs right now include &lt;a href="http://www.daniellevanier.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Danielle Vanier&lt;/a&gt; for her plus sized sass, &lt;a href="http://adorngirl.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Adorn Girl&lt;/a&gt; for her beautiful photography and insight, as well as &lt;a href="http://fashionforlunch.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Fashion For Lunch&lt;/a&gt; for her colour-filled playfulness. (It helps they're all championing the 30+ age group too!) There are so many incredible women out there doing incredible things, but if they don't fit the traditional mould they're practically invisible; I'm making an effort to show there is more than one type of blogger out there by putting more of myself on here (you may have noticed much more of my face of late!) and the reception has been so positive. It just proves we want to see something fresh and a tad more relatable than what we're being spoon-fed by the media. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I CAN TALK ABOUT PRESSING ISSUES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Being confident in yourself means that discussing mental health, smear tests, feminine hygiene and dealing with putting on weight (amongst a tonne of other things) isn't as scary or 'off brand'. My '&lt;a href="http://www.londonbeautyqueen.com/search/label/Lets%20Talk%20About%20It?max-results=9" target="_blank"&gt;Lets Talk About It&lt;/a&gt;' series last year did incredibly well and encouraged so much conversation about topics that had previously been untouched; I have plans to build on that this year and continue to talk about issues that are important to me personally. Being older and (somewhat) wiser also means I can feel confident in sharing opinions, insights and commentary on current events and not being afraid of using my influence for more than just pushing a new face cream. Collectively this makes it far more exciting to write, and hopefully far more exciting to read; whether that's being a feminist, attending your smear tests or discussing bought Instagram followers, I'm not afraid to start a conversation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;I'm really excited about the year ahead, and discovering some more amazing 30+ bloggers, so I hope you'll be on that journey with me - whether you're 23 or 83. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

You NEED The Beauty Blender Liner Designer!</title><content type='html'>I had a conversation with a friend the other day which involved muttering the immortal line "does anyone even *wear* khol anymore?" Liquid eyeliner has definitely had its moment over the last couple of years, with statement big winged looks being the makeup skill most desired; it may have started with Sofia Loren, but it's evolved into something incredibly modern and edgy - it's the simplest way to finish your look and add a subtle twist to 'no makeup makeup'. I'm a big fan of the wing, but it's taken me an age to pick up the skills required to make it half decent: get the angle wrong, the length too big or the symmetry completely wonky and it's all ruined. How many mornings have you spent trying to even out your liner in the mirror, just for the whole look to keep getting bigger and bigger until you resemble a Winehouse tribute act? Well, if that's a common issue for you then you simply NEED this little gadget from Beauty Blender in your life - because, *dramatic voice* let me assure you, it will change it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HZAvvvgVTf0/WJOB0OnkmzI/AAAAAAAAigg/yhZ-ToJxeG85HES3GMJquwQ_bzPgN8zcgCEw/s1600/Beauty%2BBlender%2BLiner%2BDesigner%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This unassuming little rubber triangle (rather fetchingly called &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2l0WVi3" target="_blank"&gt;Beauty Blender Liner Designer&lt;/a&gt; and looks closer to a guitar pick than I'd probably like,) can be placed along the base of the lower lid to create the perfect angle for your flick. You simply place it where you need it to go and draw along the edge using your eyeliner pen, paying attention to the length of the flick; because of the texture and material it's impossible for it to bleed or smudge, leaving behind a clean and sharp line that's incomparable to what I can achieve freehand. Replicate this on the other side, using the line you've already drawn and the residue on the tool (you can see the line on the edge, so you can use that as a guide on the other eye!) to create the most symmetrical pair of wings you'll have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it's a little flimsy piece of plastic, it does come in a case to prevent it from getting dirty or lost - which also features a handy mirror if you need to use one on the go. The Liner Designer is easy to wash by running it under the sink or cleaning with a face wipe, ensuring it's reusable and probably going to last you for as long as you can find it. At £10.00 it does seem expensive for a little triangle of rubber, but the idea and ease of use makes it thoroughly worth that crisp ten pound note; I honestly don't know how I used to create flicks without this! If you're feeling thrifty you could probably create your own or find one on eBay for a fraction of the price, but I'm all over this like a rash. Those little things you never knew you needed eh? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iiP9ss6GyGE/WJOBxbtLpWI/AAAAAAAAigo/UuPD6cSmcYo5jiG3FSOEm51jMO-0tnM0QCEw/s1600/Beauty%2BBlender%2BLiner%2BDesigner%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k5YIIhxCGkY/WJOBs1ZvwpI/AAAAAAAAigY/wBcU95XDKqw944vNzpeepF-lCDhRPUqawCLcB/s1600/Beauty%2BBlender%2BLiner%2BDesigner%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FSBlqSfg6sg/WJOBqL8EMNI/AAAAAAAAigo/C3c-tr8xWdwXGs2Pc2SfPjLWueaFGCsvACEw/s1600/Beauty%2BBlender%2BLiner%2BDesigner%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HvAJGCXK8Pw/WJOB3sLxbSI/AAAAAAAAigk/rB8_JvH3HUoIddikrVyy69_FEJxTYNFTgCEw/s1600/Beauty%2BBlender%2BLiner%2BDesigner%2B7.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2l0WVi3" target="_blank"&gt;Beauty Blender Liner Designer&lt;/a&gt; is available online, priced from £10.00 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Photos by the fabulous Kirsty from &lt;a href="http://fashionforlunch.net/"&gt;fashionforlunch.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHOP THE POST&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="shopthepost-widget" data-widget-id="2392292"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Most of the perfumes in my collection are from brands including Jo Malone, Shay &amp;amp; Blue and Miller Harris - although there's also a sprinkling of fashion brands (including Chanel, YSL, Burberry and Chloe) to keep my reportoire current, on-trend and also elegant. Generally speaking I bypass anything that's too 'high street' or 'celebrity' and anything that's pink and sparkly, mainly because they're either too sweet or too floral for my personal tastes. That's not to say they don't have value, but they're usually not my cup of tea. I say usually, because sometimes something comes along and pleasantly surprises your nostrils and puts your inner scent snob in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c3BG5bdFWlI/WJNfqurb_MI/AAAAAAAAif0/OiCFBNWfyXEEszQUoTNnyUDRpAwW8y0hACLcB/s1600/When%2BYour%2BInner%2BScent%2BSnob%2BIs%2BPleasantly%2BSurprised%2BJuicy%2BCouture%2527s%2BNew%2BViva%2BLa%2BJuicy%2BSucre%25CC%2581%2B7.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As a kid of the 90's and 00's, Juicy Couture are a brand I grew up  with seeing all over the pages of fashion magazines and newspapers;  their tracksuits were the look du jour at one point, with everyone going  crazy for a touch of pink velour. I've always had a bit of a love/hate  relationship with the brand in general - it reminded me of my university  days, Paris Hilton, watching Legally Blonde on repeat and feeling like a  walking fake tan advert. (How times have changed eh!) Their fragrances  have always been incredibly successful, but as a 34 year old woman I  thought my days of Juicy Couture were well and truly over. Despite that,  they come along and launch &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2jHzl91" target="_blank"&gt;Viva La Juicy Sucré&lt;/a&gt; and prove that you're never too old for a touch of OTT bling and a spritz of something sparkling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  latest incarnation in the Juicy fragrance franchise takes inspiration  'from the Viva girl’s playful personality' and provides "an irresistible  confection of delectable fruits and sweet florals, which flirt with  warm vanilla and sensual sandalwood." Unlike the other fragrances in the  collection, this is fresher and more citrus, providing a more mature  twist on sweetness while still keeping it lighthearted and fun. (You can  tell that from the bottle alone: a drizzle of icing sugar sits on top,  while the base sits within a golden cake case!) The scent opens with the  fresh fruity notes of sparkling mandarin, juicy red currant and  gardenia for a feminine edge; at the heart, orange flower and jasmine  blossom are mixed with peach nectar and finished with almond cream; the  base notes of vanilla extract and sandalwood provide a creamy warmth alongside crushed cocoa beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was all ready to sniff this and feel a little overwhelmed (I actually packed headache tablets for the launch event, just in case!) but as soon as I breathed it in my nostrils relaxed and appreciated the uplifting notes for what they offered. Although this is sweet, it's not sugary sweet; the fruity notes and sandalwood ensure the sweetness of the vanilla and cocoa is kept secondary to something all the more wearable. Although the rather extravagant marketing campaign is all about sugar overload, don't let that put you off having a sniff for yourself; although the juice nods to sweetness, the composition is more like a yummy cake with a touch of sugar on top than a box of chocolate you immediately devour. It may not be something I reach for daily, but it's definitely something I could learn to love over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you're obsessed with sweet scents, love the rest of the Juicy fragrances or simply want to explore Viva La Juicy Sucré for yourself, then you can get your hands on it right now. You'll either love it or hate it, just like the tracksuits. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9amM0IZMPn4/WJNfjJkrwuI/AAAAAAAAif8/vpe5si9rPeo6YUQSKRPfjtDrUel0evvzACEw/s1600/When%2BYour%2BInner%2BScent%2BSnob%2BIs%2BPleasantly%2BSurprised%2BJuicy%2BCouture%2527s%2BNew%2BViva%2BLa%2BJuicy%2BSucre%25CC%2581%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K61KE1ycp98/WJNftLFNbMI/AAAAAAAAif4/Jg5zAd5nQtYGHTU_GO3jJmBv0jk2FfE4ACLcB/s1600/When%2BYour%2BInner%2BScent%2BSnob%2BIs%2BPleasantly%2BSurprised%2BJuicy%2BCouture%2527s%2BNew%2BViva%2BLa%2BJuicy%2BSucre%25CC%2581%2B8.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-64MwU-27qXQ/WJNfeh5IMoI/AAAAAAAAif8/oG1AM3uXpik9gpUcWQhxuYJj0HfXcxN4gCEw/s1600/When%2BYour%2BInner%2BScent%2BSnob%2BIs%2BPleasantly%2BSurprised%2BJuicy%2BCouture%2527s%2BNew%2BViva%2BLa%2BJuicy%2BSucre%25CC%2581%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHOP THE SCENT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="shopthepost-widget" data-widget-id="2389824"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Some trips have been for work and others for pleasure, but with so many nights spent between freshly laundered sheets dreaming of a pancake breakfast the following morning, it got me thinking about why staying in a lovely hotel is really so special. I'm lucky enough to get to experience some of the most luxurious and special locations as part of my job (I've stayed in the &lt;a href="https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/london" target="_blank"&gt;Rosewood London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.babingtonhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Babington House&lt;/a&gt; in the last two weeks alone,) but I've also been making a concerted effort to book overnight stays and weekend getaways in my spare time too. My boyfriend and I have been breathing in the rustic Cotswold scenery while enjoying mini breaks at &lt;a href="http://troutinn.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;The Trout At Tadpole Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fuzzyduckarmscote.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Fuzzy Duck&lt;/a&gt; in the last few weeks, simply just because; it doesn't have to cost a fortune, but a night away from home can refresh the mind and provide something to look forward to during a dreary winter's day. So if you need a little pick me up, or simply an excuse to wack out the credit card and book yourself an escape, here are the reasons I think staying in a luxury hotel is such a pleasure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QLrW5tFNfm4/WJMGUgSDYWI/AAAAAAAAie4/he_NX_civIsT9n5k84vZJrctfw-SclpXgCLcB/s1600/The%2BTen%2BBest%2BThings%2BAbout%2BStaying%2BIn%2BA%2BHotel%2B%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AN EXCUSE TO RELAX&lt;br /&gt;We're often so focused on getting from one day to the next, ticking off our to-do list as we go, that time just runs away from us; it's hard to relax or take some time for ourselves, even when we're supposedly chilling out at home. A night away in a hotel helps you leave those worries behind, while the change of scenery and really refresh the senses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;BREAKFAST IN BED&lt;br /&gt;It's such a simple pleasure, but I just can't get enough of breakfast in bed - made my someone that's not me! Starting the day off with a full belly of expertly crafted food and a steaming cup of coffee just puts a smile on my face and a spring in my step. Pancakes, eggs or croissants, it really doesn't matter as long as it's yummy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL THE BEAUTY MINIS&lt;br /&gt;What is it about the little bottles of shampoo, shower gel and body lotion that are so exciting? Why are we always so desperate to take home the mini tubes of free toothpaste and even a packet of cotton wool buds? I love discovering what beauty freebies are lurking around the bathroom, even if I don't intend to use them; you never know what new brand you'll discover, or when that disposable toothbrush will come in handy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SOAK IN THE TUB &lt;br /&gt;Although I have a bath at home and try to take some time out in the tub every week or two, the facilities in hotels are often incomparable. Giant freestanding bathtubs are my faves, not only because they're super instagrammable, but because they make you feel like royalty. Slipping into the bubbles and sipping on a glass of something cold is the ultimate escape - even if for only fifteen minutes.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTERNOON NAPS&lt;br /&gt;Possibly my favourite thing about checking into a hotel room is falling immediately onto the bed and basically having a mid-afternoon nap. Often traveling is exhausting, but the call of a giant comfy hotel bed can help ease that lethargy and leave us feeling refreshed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST PILLOWS&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to know the secret of hotel pillows, because they're always so fluffy and comfy. I'm a little obsessed with cushions and pillows (we sleep with three each and have six more that go on top for decoration purposes!) but I just can't seem to replicate the feeling of diving into a pool of feathers at home. (If anyone knows what magic they use to get the pillows so comfy, let me know!)&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAKING UP IN A NEW DESTINATION&lt;br /&gt;The best bit about waking up in a hotel is undoubtedly being in a new location; the possibilities and opportunities to explore are endless, even if you're only there for a day. Whether you want to go for a walk, find a cute cafe or go shopping in the town's boutiques, it's always a change from your usual routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are your favourite things about staying in hotels?&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JYyo-wDmQbA/WJMGRyjKJKI/AAAAAAAAie0/YKNMhOkm3nA3FBuB4btk07WlIQUmsoqKQCEw/s1600/The%2BTen%2BBest%2BThings%2BAbout%2BStaying%2BIn%2BA%2BHotel%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Last week I had one of those. I was all up for rocking a sassy outfit, but when it's freezing and miserable outside you can only reassess and step out of the door in a cosy jumper dress in a colour to match your mood. This winter I've been embracing the jumper dress for the first time ever and I have to say I'm all over it: they're cosy and comfy without requiring any kind of effort, but look like you've actually put a little thought into your attire. Although this little number from Next is one of my current faves, the colour means I feel the need to up-the-outfit-ante with a rather delicious looking handbag that will make me feel like a boss (even though I'm secretly wishing it to be nap time.) Meet my new baby: the &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kQKkhh" target="_blank"&gt;Givenchy Antigona&lt;/a&gt; in black, with little silver stud details that I just can't get enough of.

However, when I popped by Bicester Village and saw it  on sale it was hard to resist - so much so I went back to the shop a  couple times to try it on and see if I was really that in love with it.  (Spoiler, I was.) This is why I love Bicester Village: you can pick up  items you coveted at full price on the catwalk for sometimes less than  half the price a few months later, while still enjoying that designer  shopping experience. (FYI I got this for about a third off the usual retail price, and in black! Unheard of!) It looks utterly divine and is large enough for everything I  need, while the chunky zip and studded details give it a modern edge. It's just what I needed to spice up an otherwise bland outfit and help me forget about the frizzy mop on my head caused by the day's drizzle.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-umUuVmaxp80/WJC-DB4P94I/AAAAAAAAidg/FZA1Qz69f44fw9jyGTlMQUar0tCtl1iUQCEw/s1600/Miserable%2BWeather%252C%2BCoffee%2BDates%2B%2526%2BNew%2BHandbags%2B%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jT2gaBYUMH4/WJC-EQIMyvI/AAAAAAAAidg/mgBQsM51yJkmmZP18JCZdcmpN-3LnEnkwCEw/s1600/Miserable%2BWeather%252C%2BCoffee%2BDates%2B%2526%2BNew%2BHandbags%2B%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-r61j6l8lQnQ/WJC97YIlaiI/AAAAAAAAidg/FUNGjEWPpsgPlsBbErUQ5Azs6SAVNlD-QCEw/s1600/Coffee%2BDates%2B%2526%2BNew%2BHandbags%2B%2B4.png" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"&gt;As for the watch, this is also my new obsession. &lt;a href="http://www.henry-london.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Henry London&lt;/a&gt; have a huge number of different designs and colour-ways that  ensure your arm candy has a little twist; I kept things simple by  choosing a white strap and face (it goes with more than black, believe  it or not!) and matching the metal details with my current rose gold jewellery obsession. The watches are beautifully made and you can even get the backs engraved with a special message, making them the perfect gift or keepsake. I've got my eye on a couple others for spring (more on that soon,) but in the meantime it's worth checking out their selection available online.

(Plus Why Ceramide Capsules Are Now A Regime Staple)</title><content type='html'>Right now I have an increasingly complex relationship with my face. On one hand I'm embracing the changes the years bring and celebrate the fact I'm older, wiser and more confident than I ever have been, but on the other hand I feel my youth slipping away one fine line at a time. I don't want to look like a teenager again, but the onset of deep wrinkles really quite worries me at this stage in my life (I'm sure I'll come to love them as they appear later down the line!) Anything I can do to delay the onset of the ageing process, make my skin more radiant and reduce the appearance of those little crinkles, I will - within reason. Personally things like botox and seriously invasive procedures just aren't quite me, but give me any lotion or potion and I'll slap it on happily with the aim of reducing those signs I see every day in the mirror. My skincare regime is expansive and I invest a lot of time massaging in expensive creams and taking my supplements, but that doesn't mean there isn't always something more effective and somewhat revolutionary around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UcgbHIDPV7s/WI8bQ4ngbEI/AAAAAAAAicI/ifHteUF7OU4lk7gyaxo36I_3qaFjQbX3QCLcB/s1600/Can%2BYou%2BReally%2BLook%2B10%2BYears%2BYounger%2BWhy%2BCeramide%2BCapsules%2BAre%2BNow%2BA%2BStaple%2BIn%2BMy%2BRegime%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Elizabeth Arden's &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kJEd2j" target="_blank"&gt;Ceramide Capsules&lt;/a&gt; were launched in 1990 and have become a global best seller. This bio-engineered, skin-identical ceramide formula was available in a first-of–its-kind single-dose capsule format, removing the need for preservatives and making skincare incredibly portable. If you're wondering what Ceramides are, then essentially these precious lipids form up to 50% of the skin's moisture barrier and help to keep our complexions looking youthful; they're the 'cement' that holds your skin cells together, creating a smooth and radiant surface. Inevitably the level of these Ceramides significantly drops as we age; although historically it was thought this didn't happen until the later years, increasing research has shown the decline in quantity starts from when we hit thirty. (You will have lost about 40% of your skin’s ceramides by your 30s, and more than 60% by your 40s. Ouch.) This decrease in essential lipids causes skin to appear dry, dull and can result in wrinkles, unevenness and loss of firmness - all the signs we try so hard to counteract. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you believe that the science bods behind Elizabeth Arden were the ones to first discover and harness the power of Ceramides? So much so that they trademarked the name! The original Ceramide Capsules were incredibly popular because they worked; they contained a combination of oils and lipids to help nourish the skin while plumping the surface for a smoother and more radiant glow. In celebration of 25 years of the capsules, Elizabeth Arden are re-launching them with a new and improved formula that offers triple the power of the original. When used daily, they can enhance skin’s barrier repair function, increase moisturisation within  the surface of the skin and minimise the appearance of fine lines and  wrinkles.That's what I'm talking about! So what's in these little gold capsules that makes them so special? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fatty Acids&lt;/b&gt; (including Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid and Vitamin E) help maintain the integrity of the skin’s lipid barrier for healthy-looking skin; &lt;b&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/b&gt; helps retain moisture levels to support the stratum corneum and help protect skin from dehydration; &lt;b&gt;Phytosphingosine&lt;/b&gt;, a lipid naturally found in the skin, allows and encourages the skin itself to produce the ceramides it needs; &lt;b&gt;Sea Fennel Extract&lt;/b&gt; helps to enhance skin cell renewal as well as increase luminosity and skin smoothness; a &lt;b&gt;Botanical Complex&lt;/b&gt; features Alfalfa Extract, lipids from olives and hydrocarbons from coconut oil to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, increase hydration levels and soothe skin;&lt;b&gt; Tsubaki Oil &lt;/b&gt;is rich in Oleic Acid, Vitamins A, B, D &amp;amp; E, and nourishing Omegas 3, 6 &amp;amp; 9, so has been added to help improve elasticity, minimise the look of fine lines and wrinkles while enhancing moisture for smooth, supple skin; and finally &lt;b&gt;Retinyl Palmitate&lt;/b&gt; is a Vitamin A derivative that works to support skin’s own natural collagen for a firmer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a lot of power in one little dose. Most 'anti ageing' formulas focus on hydration via hylaronic acid, increasing cell turnover for brightness and improved texture or encouragning collagen production; these capsules are full of so much more and actually help to re-build the skin from within. I've always been aware of these iconic capsules, but I made the (incorrect) assumption that they were targeted at 40 or 50+ skin rather than being able to meet my changing 30+ needs. After getting to know the science and evidence behind the skincare, I'm confident that this is what I need to take my skincare regime to the next level and help fend off those fine lines a little longer. I love the fact they're portable (no more lugging huge bottles of serum away with me) and easy to integrate into my routine (they don't have to replace anything but can just boost your existing products - I use after Elizabeth Arden SuperStart and before my usual moisturiser) even if they are a little expensive (roughly about £1.00 a capsule depending how many you buy at once.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is like a very lightweight non-greasy oil that glides over skin and absorbs pretty quickly to leave the surface feeling instantly smoother and more radiant; I've only been using these for a couple of weeks but I'm already hooked. I've yet to look 25 again, but with ongoing use I've no doubt I can certainly look my best. And as for the ten years younger claim? The capsules have been proven to take up to 10 years off the look of skin, based on a clinical study of 44 women aged 36-64 after 12 weeks of use. (They did this by measuring the characteristics of skin before and after the study, known to occur during certain decades; so much were the results, that many moved from one decade characterisation to the previous in only a few months!) In addition to this, 100% of women in the study showed an improvement in the overall appearance of their skin and 95% demonstrated a significant improvement in visible firmness after just two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of brands try to make incredible claims or sell you pots of stuff you don't need off the back of falsehoods, but in this instance I've seen the data and the corresponding images - and millions of women around the globe can't be wrong. I'm slapping these on my face like there's no tomorrow and can't see that changing any time soon; who knew a little golden capsule could make such a big impact?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever used these golden capsules? Would you be tempted to give them a go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gh32ToXfW30/WI8bQVNNZ1I/AAAAAAAAicE/fY01YN-epDksvyxKeCHP7D1KXChSkm30QCEw/s1600/Can%2BYou%2BReally%2BLook%2B10%2BYears%2BYounger%2BWhy%2BCeramide%2BCapsules%2BAre%2BNow%2BA%2BStaple%2BIn%2BMy%2BRegime%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1jk3cyQn5lg/WI8bSexpPvI/AAAAAAAAicM/7a_CJpyF5Pk7RhZMlgLVT8CeggAt1wvXACEw/s1600/Can%2BYou%2BReally%2BLook%2B10%2BYears%2BYounger%2BWhy%2BCeramide%2BCapsules%2BAre%2BNow%2BA%2BStaple%2BIn%2BMy%2BRegime%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elizabeth Arden '&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kJEd2j" target="_blank"&gt;Advanced Ceramide Capsules Daily Youth Restoring Serum Capsules&lt;/a&gt;' are available now priced as follows: 90pc £84.00 / 60pc £66.00 / 30pc £39.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHOP THE POST&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="shopthepost-widget" data-widget-id="2377800"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Fake Followers Are On The Increase (And 20% Of PRs Don't Care) </title><content type='html'>&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Although it started as an organic, raw and exciting way to share thoughts and opinions, there's no doubting that blogging has now become a numbers game. It's all about how many followers you've got on Instagram, what your Klout score is and the number of YouTube views each video gets. I get it, I really do; brands want to generate as much exposure as they possibly can and to get maximum return on their investment, so the number of eyeballs is the easiest thing to focus on. When historically we've all only had magazine circulation figures (often hugely inflated or manipulated) to go on, this is the one statistic that keeps being measured as the ultimate level of success - and expectations keep increasing. With some superstar bloggers and vloggers speaking to millions of people every single month, it's easy to get wrapped up in seeking as high a number as possible and using that as the only metric of success. However, this numbers-led culture within the bloggersphere is causing one huge problem that seems to be getting increasingly worse: bought followers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WCzJNm2rb3U/WItydg8J4oI/AAAAAAAAibg/5VJZij988mEzVYWpMjT2SGFIktwQazJCgCLcB/s1600/It%2527s%2BA%2BLying%2BShame.%2BFake%2BFollowers%2BAre%2BOn%2BThe%2BIncrease%2B%2528And%2B20%2BOf%2BPRs%2BDon%2527t%2BCare%2529%2B%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's surprisingly easy (and cheap) to buy your way to the top these days. All it takes is a couple of quid, a few minutes out of your day and BOOM you've got yourself another couple of thousand Instagram followers. The platforms that offer these services are becoming increasingly savvy, ensuring their fake accounts look and feel like real ones - they have real names, real faces and real photos on their own feeds, but if you look a little harder you start to see through the illusion. What's even more worrying is that these falsified accounts aren't just appearing on little known blogger's feeds, but on some of the most well known and respected in the industry; even one of the biggest UK beauty editors is well known for buying her way to 100k Instagram followers and as a result is heralded in the press as one of the best beauty insiders on social media. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Although that's a problem in itself (lies always get caught out in the end,) what I find increasingly worrying is the number of brands, PRs and industry insiders that know about these falsified audiences and continue to work with the bloggers regardless. I've had conversations with a handful of brand representatives myself about the issue and have been met with shrugged shoulders, only for them to book the influencer in question for a big campaign a few weeks later. I was worried and baffled: was I the only one thinking it was unethical to buy your way to the top, ask for money to be part of a campaign only for your audience to be significantly non-existent? As a result you may have seen the poll I ran a couple of weeks ago on Twitter (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LBQblog/status/819159958411497472" target="_blank"&gt;see the poll here,&lt;/a&gt;) which asked the question: &lt;i&gt;"Do you care if (you suspect) a blogger has bought their social followers?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was this: unsuprisingly 85% of the bloggers who answered said they did, with the remaining 15% not caring at all. (I get it: you may just like their content and don't give a rats arse what's going on with their following, real or otherwise. In fact some of the bloggers suspected to have hugely falsified followings are actual incredible content creators - which makes it even more frustrating.) However, 160 PRs answered my poll and around 20% of them admitted they didn't care if they knew or suspected an influencer had bought their followers. That means that around 20% of my sample study knowingly work with bloggers, vloggers or social media starts that they suspect or know to have a fake following. And do not care. Let’s just reiterate that once again: they do not care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this is two fold: 1. that brands are being fed information on bloggers that is one-dimensional, inflated and inaccurate, so their ongoing expectations are distorted, and 2. that the bloggers in question are often charging a small fortune, getting the great campaigns and taking work away from other people that are working to build a true and authentic audience. When it’s no longer a free lipstick or invitation to a cocktail reception, and instead exotic holidays, designer handbags and campaigns that see their faces plastered over billboards and in stores nationwide, it’s time to start saying this is not ok. It's all very well and good to ignore it or think "don't worry, they'll get caught out in the end!" or "cheaters never get ahead!" But the problem is they are; they're getting ahead and they're getting ahead at the expense of everyone else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts are somewhat torn on who is to blame for this current situation and who is making it worse. As bloggers we’re always being driven to justify why a brand should want to work with us, and those conversations 99% of the time focus on numbers; very few discussions involve influence, engagement or relevancy - because at the end of the day everyone's objective is to sell stuff, the focus should be on how likely an audience is to buy based on a recommendation or feature, not how many people may have seen a picture of it and scrolled on by. (Some of my blogger friends have much smaller audiences than me, but their engagement is insane; their followers lap up everything they say, buy everything they recommend and comment on every single thing they publish. You just can't buy that sh*t.) These questions and constant justifications make us all a little paranoid about our numbers, so it's easy to understand why some may feel the need to give themselves a helping hand.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell: brands want numbers, PRs need to deliver on  numbers, PRs search for bloggers with big numbers so they can tick boxes  and report on the great job they've done, bloggers feel a bit inadequate with all the questions and focus on numbers, bloggers buy followers, numbers make PR happy, PR makes brand happy by giving them big numbers. Do you see how it's a vicious circle? Until the circle ends, until everyone makes a concerted effort to educate brands about the importance of engagement and relevancy, this shady behaviours will continue and it's only going to get worse. I've heard so many stories about bloggers creating a whole fake identity and blagging their way into campaigns, launches, trips and experiences off of the back of a falsified Instagram account - because nobody bothered to check. I've seen digital influencers scoop their own makeup collaborations and big brand campaigns from an inflated social presence - because nobody bothered to check. If you're a PR or work with bloggers in some capacity, please take a little time and bother to check (for everyone involved.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been running my blog for nearly seven years and I've had some amazing experiences and opportunities land in my inbox. It's hard not to compare yourself to people that have got twice the following you have in half the time, but I have to remind myself that I have a niche and I'm proud of that niche; everything I've done has been generated because of hard work, love and passion - not cheating. Although buying a few followers doesn't mean what the blogger produces doesn't have value (often the opposite,) it does seem incredibly unfair on those of us that creep up gradually with pure grit and determination. This kind of activity reflects badly on all of us; it reflects negatively on the industry as a whole, when we're already perceived as giggling girls with swishy hair and nothing much to say for themselves. We have to justify our existence so often that it's becoming exhausting, and this really isn't helping. Collectively we need to keep bossing it and proving that we DO have value, that we DO have something to say, that we DO have influence and we won't be going anywhere fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I feel like I'm in the digital version of The Emperor's New Clothes: we all know the followers aren't real, including the said Emperor/Empress, but everyone is just smiling sweetly and applauding because they're afraid of whatever fall out will follow. Here's hoping fakeness isn't on-trend again this SS17. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="bloglovin-widget" data-blog-id="2158708" data-img-src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/2158708" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bloglovin.com/widget/bilder/en/widget.gif?id=2158708" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://madmimi.com/signups/147076/join" target="_blank"&gt;SIGN UP TO MY NEWS BLAST HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;(EXCLUSIVE NEWS, COMPETITIONS &amp;amp; CONTENT YOU WON'T FIND ON THE BLOG!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Features PR samples unless otherwise stated.

Three Beautiful New Scents For Spring You'll Want To Buy For Yourself</title><content type='html'>&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Spring has such a unique scent. The aroma of freshly cut grass, the first sprig of a daffodil and a cold glass of rose wine as the sun goes down is such a refreshing antidote to the heavy and woody notes of winter. I do adore the onset of colder weather and the scent of a cracking fire, but after a few months it's a welcome change to finally start to disrobe and celebrate the sun once again. As we get that little bit closer to Valentines Day (love it or hate it) there's a plethora of new fragrances that are hitting shelves to offer the perfect gift for a loved one, but there are also so many that are so pretty that they're definitely worth treating yourself to too. (Who needs a guy/gal to buy it for them anyway?) I've currently got three faves on rotation that I couldn't wait to share with you - which will you choose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2x9uhqiPdF8/WInOOrCSb7I/AAAAAAAAia0/_8R4kvZaMWYZFTUk8v0PbFUUmgCLdgyWQCLcB/s1600/Three%2BBeautiful%2BNew%2BScents%2BFor%2BSpring%2B%2Belizabeth%2Barden%2Bwhite%2Btea%2Bjimmy%2Bchoo%2Ble%2Beau%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Bmyrrh%2B%2526%2Btonka%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kw3KvS" target="_blank"&gt;Jimmy Choo L'Eau&lt;/a&gt; (From £36.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An incredibly successful mini brand of its own, the Jimmy Choo scent collection is normally a bit too sweet or too heavy for my personal takes - but this is a much lighter, fresher and more wearable addition that's perfect for transitioning into spring. Top notes of hibiscus flower and bergamot blend with sweet nectarine and floral peony, but the notes are grounded by base notes of cedarwood and musk. You can definitely sense the delicate fruity notes which make the feminine floral elements softer and more modern; it reminds me somewhat of DKNY Be Delicious and the uplifting experience it provides with every spritz, but packaged in a glamorous and timeless bottle that will look so much better on your dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DXm0afILpPY/WInDYazhQfI/AAAAAAAAiaI/5BjxRKxhp38_86FVmIq5afj0C4AVrBAuQCEw/s1600/Three%2BBeautiful%2BNew%2BScents%2BFor%2BSpring%2B%2Belizabeth%2Barden%2Bwhite%2Btea%2Bjimmy%2Bchoo%2Ble%2Beau%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Bmyrrh%2B%2526%2Btonka%2B%2B4.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2kweMBu" target="_blank"&gt;Jo Malone Cologne Intense Myrrh &amp;amp; Tonka&lt;/a&gt; (From £74.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for the fainthearted, this fragrance is incredibly intense and long lasting - you only need a spritz on your neck to be doused in the scent for the rest of the day. (Beware of over-applying, because you will give yourself a headache.) Described as "Namibia, with its sand dunes and warm desert colours, conjured up the romance of faraway lands" by Jo Malone's Fragrance Director, this is a truly unique and exotic scent that warms the senses and comforts the mind. For those of you that love oriental perfumes, this is definitely for you. With top notes of lavender, a heart of warming myrrh and base of tonka bean, this makes a statement and feels expensive without overbearing the wearer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nvMRlPtLuJE/WInDeeTOInI/AAAAAAAAiaU/luXEFt7foGwsHirrjpiqYE7GnhfFDpZwgCEw/s1600/Three%2BBeautiful%2BNew%2BScents%2BFor%2BSpring%2B%2Belizabeth%2Barden%2Bwhite%2Btea%2Bjimmy%2Bchoo%2Ble%2Beau%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Bmyrrh%2B%2526%2Btonka%2B%2B7.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2jhXWBc" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Arden White Tea&lt;/a&gt; (£36.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a preconception of what this may smell like because of the brand name, leave all of that at the door and open your mind. Elizabeth Arden are known for their classic, somewhat heavy and overly floral fragrances - but this new incarnation is completely the opposite. Light, fresh, modern and elegant, this is a fragrance you'll want to wear every day; it's like the white t-shirt of scents - classic, unobtrusive, but brings everything together seamlessly. The notes include mandarin, clary sage, white fern, sea breeze accord, white tea, rose, musk, amber, madras wood, ambrette seed and tonka bean, together bringing about something complex yet incredibly simple. This is the perfect scent to mindlessly apply every morning without having to worry if it goes with your outfit or mood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ayH4lf7Aa2s/WInDcRSQUEI/AAAAAAAAiaQ/d0_d3A5lO6QVGnHq3YwceX5q7WQeWHJMwCEw/s1600/Three%2BBeautiful%2BNew%2BScents%2BFor%2BSpring%2B%2Belizabeth%2Barden%2Bwhite%2Btea%2Bjimmy%2Bchoo%2Ble%2Beau%2Bjo%2Bmalone%2Bmyrrh%2B%2526%2Btonka%2B%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Got a fave from my selection above or another scent you're loving for the forthcoming spring months?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHOP THE POST&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="shopthepost-widget" data-widget-id="2367419"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(d,s,id){var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Why Is It So Important To Stand Up Right Now? We Are Not Equal. </title><content type='html'>&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;This weekend women (and men) walked in their millions to protest a multitude of issues that have touched all of our lives in one way or another. Although many believe it to be an unnecessary commotion against the Trump regime which will make no difference, the #WomensMarch was so much more than that; the images that have filled my social media feeds over the last few days have shown that this was more than just a popular protest against a new president, but a way of us all expressing our frustration, anger, sadness and worry of what's to come. In the last few decades we've progressed so much on the road to equality, but we're really not there yet - if anything, we're set to take a step back over the coming few years as Trump revokes legislation that made a real difference to people far beyond US borders. (Partner that with the impending Brexit mess, where established European equality rights are under threat too, and we're in a bit of a mess.) And that's why these marches went global; that's why these events saw people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, sexualities and ages take to the streets with their sassy signs to show everyone that they'd had enough. That's why the fight is just beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6H1jdsfdJ2M/WIeGCVlG1lI/AAAAAAAAiZk/JeBeejjye3gJyZ0ACoGKs6pCisuVbP13ACLcB/s1600/Put%2BOn%2BYour%2BWar%2BPaint.%2BWhy%2BIs%2BIt%2BSo%2BImportant%2BTo%2BStand%2BUp%2BRight%2BNow%2BWe%2BAre%2BNot%2BEqual.%2B.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT BE AFRAID OF CALLING YOURSELF A FEMINIST&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As far as I'm concerned (unless you're an arsehole,) everyone should be a feminist. (It's a scary word, I get it, but if you're not a feminist then please explain your reasoning?) In case you're wondering, feminism is defined as a range of political movements, ideologies and social movements that share a common goal: to define, establish and achieve political, economic, personal and social rights for women. This includes seeking to establish equal opportunities in education and employment, access to healthcare and to be at no disadvantage simply because of their gender. Who would not want that? As a feminist (and yes I'm proud to use that label,) I'm willing to do  what I can (no matter how small) to make a change for the future and  impact lives around the world in a positive way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been fortunate enough to have grown up in an environment that encouraged me to do whatever I wanted to do, to break down barriers and to reach for the stars; yet I have still had to fight for equal pay and recognition in the workplace, to justify my place at a meeting table simply because I have boobs and to prove that I can be interested in lipstick and politics simultaneously. Over the last few decades we've progressed so far, but there is still a long road ahead of us - as we can all testament to when we really start to think about what impact inequality has on a daily basis. (And this is even before we start to consider the inequality of WOC, LGBT and disabled women. Then I just want to cry.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As women we still make less than a man for doing the same job - whether that’s in tech, as a CEO, as an athlete or as a doctor. As women we still don’t have full rights over our own bodies, as men are continually debating and making choices that impact our uteruses. As women we still have to pay tax on sanitary products because they’re classified as a ‘luxury’. (If men had periods you know that would have been scrapped decades ago.) As a woman we still have to justify our outfit choices and defend ourselves when men think they have the right to touch us. As a woman we still have to fight to breastfeed in public and apologise for those we offend in the process. As women we’re constantly scrutinised for our appearance, whether that’s a celebrity who is a bit soft around the tummy or a Prime Minister who happens to like shoes. As women we’re valued on our looks rather than our brains, but suffer vitriol if we dare take care of our appearance more than is deemed acceptable. It's exhausting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BE THANKFUL FOR THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE YOU &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If it wasn’t for those that came before us standing up and wanting to be heard, we would not have the lives we do now. We wouldn’t have had the right to an equal education or even the right to work; we wouldn't have had the right to vote or have a say in our own futures; we wouldn’t have access to birth control, the right to choose or able to have a legal abortion carried out in a safe environment. Every day I'm grateful for those that paved the way and made my existence what is is, because without them our situation would be way worse than it is - but it could still be better. For those of you that don't understand why women marched in their millions this past weekend, or wondered what difference it would really make, and for those of you that don't deem yourself disadvantaged because of your gender: we are not equal, whichever way you look at it, and that is why a revolution is coming. I can understand those that want to shy away from hard hitting issues, who prefer to let others do the hard work in their name, but be respectful of the fact you would not be enjoying the opportunities you do if it were not for others. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT CAN WE DO? HOW CAN WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We all have a voice, no matter how big or how small, and now is the time to use it. If you have a platform, put it to work: share stories, start conversations and show people what needs to be changed. If you're a blogger or an influencer, don't be afraid of using your platform to talk about more than shoes or mascara - because if you're interested in women's rights then your readers will be too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join the &lt;a href="http://www.womensequality.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Women's Equality&lt;/a&gt; party, who are trying to make change in the UK by championing equality and women's rights. They want to achieve equal pay, equal parenting, equal access to support and equal opportunities by getting their voices heard in parliament; joining the party costs as little as £4.00 a month and could make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow &lt;a href="https://www.womensmarchlondon.com/10-actions" target="_blank"&gt;Women's March London&lt;/a&gt; and be part of their '10 Changes In 100 Days' campaign. In the coming weeks they'll be providing ways in which each one of us can keep the momentum moving following the marches, as well as providing a UK focal point for those of us that feel like they want to do something but they're not sure what. The first of which is...&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email our Prime Minister, Theresa May, and ask her to  champion women's equality whenever there's an opportunity - starting  with her meeting with President Trump this coming Friday. Ask her to  affirm our country's belief that women's rights are human rights, and to  not waiver in the upholding of our ideals in favour of a trade deal.  Write her a letter, send her an email or pop her a postcard with your  thoughts to 10 Downing Street, SW1A 2AA or via &lt;a href="https://email.number10.gov.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;email.number10.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And above all, stay informed. Read the newspapers, watch the documentaries, discuss what's going on with your colleagues. Within days of Trump taking office he's reversed a bill that provided healthcare and support to women in developing and war torn countries, because the same institutions that provide support may also facilitate an abortion. That's not ok and it's not the solution. Stopping access to healthcare and safe treatment only causes women to be forced into dangerous situations; they're not able to stand up for themselves, so its our responsibility to champion their causes for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now my feeds are jampacked with inspirational content and discussion around these issues, and I really hope that doesn't waiver. Although I'm realistic and know that a few marches won't change the world, it's important that we still stand up and try to make a difference in the years to come.

I adore it as a way to be visually inspired, see what some of my favourite bloggers are up to and connect with brands that mean a lot to me, but it's also easy to spend hours endlessly scrolling through utter rubbish in the hope you'll find that one square that makes it all worth it. It's addictive, but it can also leave us feeling a bit crap if we're not careful enough to peel ourselves away from the screen. If, like me, you get a bit happy on the 'follow' button and your feed is full of stuff you'd rather not see (or Instagram isn't the inspirational, motivational and dreamy place you keep hearing others talk about,) then there are six main types of account you really need to get rid of, stat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rbu1PhDn0r0/WIZm0yeUbtI/AAAAAAAAiZE/PAeEdXTR13sDIJPmJ2Ps2ZTau8PvMkwYACLcB/s1600/Six%2BAccounts%2BYou%2BReally%2BNeed%2BTo%2BUnfollow%2BOn%2BInstagram%2B1.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SERIAL POSTER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You know who I'm talking about. The one that insists on posting ten pictures up all at once every time they step outside, jamming up your feed with grainy/blurry/boring shots that are better placed elsewhere. Some people don't grasp the fact that Instagram should be an edited feed, not a flurry of pictures that aren't even captioned - and most of the time these people are your mates (or even your mum.) Take my advice and unfollow them, keeping in touch via other platforms where the spamming isn't so prevalent. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CLEAN EATING MAFIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I get it. You eat all the green food, whizz up a smoothie for breakfast and boss your steamed chicken dinner every night - but I'm over here munching on a biscuit and wondering what's even in that gloopy green mess. We all need a little inspo, but sometimes it's just too much and ends up making us feel bad about our own decisions; if those super clean food accounts are making you whimper, rather than keeping you motivated, click unfollow and get yourself a bacon sarnie.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE 'WHO ARE YOU'-ER&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ever connected with someone at an event or birthday party, clicked on a suggested account or followed an old work colleague who you'll probably never see again? If you can barely remember who they are or why you followed them, you don't need that in your life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CHEESE-FEST MOTIVATOR&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A good quote or motivational post can set you up for the day ahead, there's no doubting it, but if it becomes a cheese-fest of verbal diarrhea then it's time to back away slowly. Nobody is *that* upbeat or feels like their #girlbossing every moment of every day; if the 'motivational' posts are making your eyes roll so hard that you're giving yourself a headache, maybe that account is not for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE IRONIC ANIMAL ACCOUNT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;At one time you may have thought a talking goat was hilarious, it bringing an undeniable amount of joy into your life, but that time has passed and you've seen more goat gifs than one person could ever need. I've followed people that post fifteen pictures of their hamster every day, or those that are obsessed with dressing their dog in the latest fashions, but that gets real tired real quick. And when a dog is more stylish than you, there's a problem... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL SH*T&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We all compare ourselves to other people; it doesn't matter if you're a superstar or a mum of three living in Leeds, looking at aspirational and overly curated pictures all the time can make us feel a bit 'meh'. Comparison really is the thief of joy, so if there's an account you look at that just makes you feel a bit sh*t (about your looks, weight, lifestyle, home, belongings, life choices, career and so on,) just unfollow that crap and get on with your life. Whether it's the blogger that gets all the opportunities you want, the friend from school that's had some kind of 'She's All That' makeover or that super lean fitness guru who makes you ashamed to even look at your stomach, pass go and collect that £200. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src="https://widget.bloglovin.com/widget/scripts/bl.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Have we all unfollowed? Is our feed now renewed with tonnes of great content we never knew was there?

Over the last couple of weeks there hasn't been that much newness (or new-on-my-desk-ness) worthy of your attention, so this time around it's an edit of some of the more exciting bits and pieces that have made their way to me over the last month or so - and for one reason or another I've not written about them previously. When the sunshine seems so far away and the cold weather is playing havoc with our skin, it's the perfect time to give yourself a pamper and get to know some new treats that will undoubtedly tickle your fancy. I've pulled together an edit of ten things I think you'll love getting to know, none of which cost a fortune either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dEiRzrDYx_s/WIYOmjEM_7I/AAAAAAAAiYQ/jKphrzoJckAPtWDx-KBdSImqa-nq4vLlwCEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B1%2B.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MTNZHUV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01MTNZHUV&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=lonbeaque0c-21" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maskorea 3-in-1 Sheet Masks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lonbeaque0c-21&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=2&amp;amp;a=B01MTNZHUV" height="1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /&gt; (£7.99 each)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheet masks aren't new (in fact they've been clogging up my inbox for the best part of a year,) but what intrigues me about the versions from Maskorea is that they come with two little sachets of product to ensure you get the most benefit from the experience. Each features a cleanser to use before and ensure there's no trace of makeup or dirt left to prevent the enriched mask from getting to work, as well as a night cream to apply afterwards to boost the benefits and hydrate the skin. Available in three variants (Too Many Late Nights, Turn Back The Clock and Instant Glow) this is a fun take on the trend. Personally I prefer my usual skincare products to those included, but I love the idea.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.superdrug.com/B-/B-Confident-Hyaluronic-Acid-Spritz/p/653301" target="_blank"&gt;'B' Hylaronic Acid Facial Spritz&lt;/a&gt; (£7.99)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually more popular in the summer, facial spritzes are a great way to perk up skin or refresh the senses during the day. However, this version from Superdrug's own skincare range 'B' is enriched with hylaronic acid to help plump the skin and restore moisture when skin is looking and feeling a little parched. You can use it as a first step when applying your morning skincare, spritz over makeup for a dewy and refreshed look or add a touch throughout the day when you need a boost; the mist isn't the finest and it takes a bit of getting used to before you get the perfect amount, but it's a great little treat to pop in your handbag when the cold zaps all the goodness from our complexions. A steal at £7.99 too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2j5uOwI" target="_blank"&gt;Beauty Bakerie Lip Whips&lt;/a&gt; (£16.00 each)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matte liquid lipsticks are definitely my faves right now, thanks to the long-lasting result and modern twist on traditional lipstick formulas that just seems to give a look new life. These little gems from Beauty Bakerie are du jour; not only do they look gorgeous and remind me of chocolate ice cream, but they apply beautifully to leave an incredibly pigmented result behind. You do have to thoroughly exfoliate and delicately tap balm into the surface of lips to get the best result (and maybe if you're concious of fine lines give this a miss,) but they're just beaut. If you can't get your hands on a Kylie kit, these are a great alternative. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t5_KKvW1isc/WIYOhiIF0rI/AAAAAAAAiYM/vvInyrmcilYw3zSbirwRotq7kDPjsP3eQCEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B%2B9.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EIEvbqAgw5s/WIYOpYXCAXI/AAAAAAAAiYU/lXSyiIIuVdYG8P0MZptPJtQmaEGEQfW7wCEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B10.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://A body boosting blend of 21 Mediterranean essential oils including juniper, clove, cypress &amp;amp; thyme, renowned for their muscle soothing and detoxifying superpowers, in a lush base of natural oils - sesame, avocado, jojoba, kukui, grapeseed, soybean &amp;amp; coconut. " target="_blank"&gt;Temple Spa 'Work It Out' Muscle-Tox Bathing &amp;amp; Massage Oil&lt;/a&gt; (£25.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been back in the gym this January, which means I tend to spend the day after each session feeling a little sore. This beautifully scented oil has been specifically developed to help ease tension and help massage away stress, thanks to a blend of 21 Mediterranean essential oils (including juniper, clove, cypress and thyme) in a lush base of sesame, avocado, jojoba, kukui, grapeseed, soybean and coconut oil. It also claims to 'detox', but I'm not convinced on that front; for me it's enough to have an affordable bottle of oil that's full of goodness and will help to restore my flexibility after a long soak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2jQEQWL" target="_blank"&gt;La Roche-Posay Respectissme Extension Mascara&lt;/a&gt; (£16.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's this? Skincare favourite La Roche delving into the world of makeup? Is this a sign of things to come in 2017? Developed for more sensitive eyes and those that wear contacts (myself included,) this mascara is pleasant enough - but not groundbreaking in terms of performance. However, it has gone through rigorous tolerance testing on people with severe atopy, under dermatological and ophthalmological control; it’s fragrance and paraben free, while the pigments used are purified and nickel-controlled to avoid any eye or skin irritation. Rather interestingly the mascara contains an ‘anti-tears formula’, with Reconstituted Lachrymal Liquid, which imitates a tears natural composition ensuring eyes do not react or run. There's still a lot of stuff in here that could be a potential irritant so it's worth having a look at the ingredient list before you buy, but I like the idea of this for those of you that suffer with eye irritation and usually have to steer clear of mascara. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o5wC0pe8oms/WIYOaDgMEEI/AAAAAAAAiYE/IArE3WGQnect2B28Guvq9yOPDyez4IjTACEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B%2B2.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://www.boots.com/en/PIZ-BUIN-Glacier-Cream-SPF-30-High-40ml_1735526/" target="_blank"&gt;Piz Buin Glacier Cream&lt;/a&gt; (£11.00) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got any skiing trips coming up, or just simply want to stock up in case there's a snowstorm? This tin is inspired by the very first formula of Piz Buin launched in 1946. It's water-free and formulated to help protect against extreme elements, while simultaenosuly protecting against UVA and UVB rays; I love the little tin and think it's the perfect thing to slip into your ski suit (or handbag.) Just be careful of the formula though, as it's white and quite thick, meaning you need only the smallest amount; this really isn't to be used under makeup daily, but instead is a hardworking helping hand for when you're exposed to the elements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_IUOd4tupw4/WIYOt_FBXwI/AAAAAAAAiYY/NXiMiHGr7609DUasB2auDvK6a717HptoACEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B3.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. &lt;a href="http://uk.loccitane.com/shea-violet-women-solidarity-balm,83,1,29776,999508.htm?type=Generic_PPC&amp;amp;gclid=CLK55tPK2NECFQrjGwod7NQH8A" target="_blank"&gt;L'Occitane Solidarity Balm&lt;/a&gt; (£4.00)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever year L’Occitane launch a limited edition little pot of balm that does good for your skin - as well as for the community. Formulated with 98% shea butter, this year it’s a violet-scented Women’s Solidarity Balm which nourishes the lips, rescues fragile cuticles and pampers the body. 100% of the profits will be used to support women’s leadership in developing countries, which has never been so topical as it is today. The balm itself is incredibly lightweight and nourishing, whilst providing just a hint of fragrance to perk you up on a dreary afternoon; the slightly sweet scent perfectly complements the bright and bold packaging, making it £4.00 well spent. Buy one for all your friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AxI9TdmGkjM/WIYOdWck9EI/AAAAAAAAiYI/3X67CVspCC0tK671W7FH1Lg-RmwlR9sfwCEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B%2B5.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. &lt;a href="http://www.glamglow.co.uk/products/18731/shop-treatments/sexy-lips" target="_blank"&gt;GlamGlow Plumprageous &amp;amp; PoutMud Treatments&lt;/a&gt; (£18.00 and £16.00) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Known for their trademark face masks, GlamGlow are expanding into the world of lip treatments with the launch of new plumping formulas in both gloss and matte finishes. In a nutshell PoutMud is basically a lip balm that offers a little tingle and subtle pout, while the Plumprageous helps to add more noticeable volume before you apply your usual lipstick or gloss. Unlike a lot of plumping products that leave my lips stinging, these provide a very comfortable sensation; although I'm not overwhelmed by the result, I don't really want to look like I've just had lip fillers. The balm comes in a very cute silver pot and is practical enough to pop in your bag, while the Plumprageous comes in a metallic tube that twists to reveal the leaf shaped applicator. These won't blow your mind, but they are worth trying out if you're a fan of lip plumpers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. &lt;a href="http://www.soeco.co.uk/where-to-buy/" target="_blank"&gt;SoEco Rose Gold Blush Brush&lt;/a&gt; (£6.25)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be forgiven for thinking this little number was twice the price, but SoEco are a brand that prove you don't have to spend a fortune to get a great tool. I've used them many times before, but the latest collection included rose gold ferrules which bring them bang up to date; the soft bristles are a pleasure to use, while the bamboo handle is sustainably sourced and custom made for the most comfortable grip. Available in Tesco, Sainsbury's and Bodycare stores, this is one accessories brand you'll want to get on your radar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dnRJzLko29M/WIYOxdpEycI/AAAAAAAAiYc/Dg7Ht41oTP8NGXy-4N4cmQ3GP6q04QnMwCEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B6.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2j5BUBo" target="_blank"&gt;L'Occitane Shea Butter Hand Balm&lt;/a&gt; (£21.00)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you adore the original hand cream already, then I guarantee you'll be obsessed with this even more nourishing version. Enriched with 25% more shea butter than the cream, this super rich balm melts when it comes into contact with the skin to leave the surface soothed and nourished - with no greasy feeling whatsoever. Because it's so rich I find I use less than I would normally opt for, meaning it provides even more value and a longer-lasting tube. My hands have really been suffering of late, but just a couple of applications of this has zapped away dryness to leave digits that look ten years younger. It's love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MBWtGNQEfqY/WIYOWuEBGeI/AAAAAAAAiYA/utlInaHzvHApQj_s9-ko77avjFWlVfnZwCEw/s1600/New%2Bin%2Bthis%2Bweek%2Bpiz%2Bbuin%2Bloccitane%2Bbeauty%2Bbakerie%2Bmaskorea%2Bla%2Broche%2Bposay%2Beco%2Btools%2Btemple%2Bspa%2Bglam%2Bglow%2Blip%2Bhand%2Bbalm%2Blip%2Bcolour%2Bpaint%2Bkit%2Bmascara%2Bbath%2Boil%2B%2B8.png" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one of these ten have got you excited?
